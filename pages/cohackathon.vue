    <p class="base">
      The <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">cooperation</a>-based hackathon
      represents the next step of the classic hackathon. In the classic version
      the company or the organization invites several developers and designers
      to create an application based on the some specific briefing. The
      participants compete either alone or in teams to win a prize in a given
      time. They are requested to show an alpha demo of their innovative
      application. The award is assigned by an external jury or directly by the
      client itself. Nevertheless, the competitive aspect of the hackathon has
      the negative effect to make all the losing participants disappointed and
      unwilling to share the event outcome, while

      point out hackathons may be seen as a form of exploitation.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">HACKING THE HACKATHON</p>
    <p class="base">
      In the Cohackathon the competitive side is used only in the selection of
      the best ideas. Being a transparent process, sometimes this can lead to an
      <a class="ad" href="/integration">integration</a> that makes more ideas to
      merge and become more powerful. The realisation of the prototypes and the
      final presentation are developed by everyone who wants to continue after
      the idea selection. The final award will be collectively achieved and
      distributed among the participants, who will celebrate together the common
      accomplishment.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">THE PLEASURE OF HACKING TOGETHER</p>
    <p class="base">
      The Cohackathon leverages on the full
      <a class="ad" href="/diversity">diversity</a> potential of the present
      participants. The same innovation output of the hackathon, if not even
      more, is achieved, with the advantage to focus all the available resources
      on the ideas development and realisation. Avoiding a single winner,
      moreover, generates a satisfactory feeling in all the attendants, which
      participate in the future dissemination of the output.<br /><br />
      When the company does not need an application solving its specific
      indications right away, a different, live, open meeting is possible: the
