    <p class="base">You may <span class="diversity">love</span> <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">doing things together</a>.</p><br>

    <p class="base">You could be one who believes that doing things together is advantageous and useful to bring a real change, but you would like to do it keeping a <a class="af" href="/cooperation#freedom">personal space for yourself</a>.<br><br>

    Or you may be one of those who believe that <a class="ae" href="/platform">changing the world</a> starts with a new <a class="au" href="/cooperation">awareness</a>.<br><br>

    For example, you may believe in <a class="au" href="/science">science</a> and technology but want them to be respectful of the people’s <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">feelings</a>.<br><br>

    Maybe you don’t want to be constantly influenced in your <a class="af" href="/governance">decisions</a>. You want to follow your true desires, making your abilities meet your professional <a class="af" href="/cooperation#freedom">life</a>. You probalby dream about a social system that <a class="ad" href="/integration">integrates</a> the different personalities of everyone in a creative and balanced way.<br><br>

    You could be looking for an open world, where you’re not afraid to be <a class="ai" href="/cooperation#transparency">honest</a> all the time because people and institutions agree to share information in a <a class="ae" href="/cooperation#transparency">transparent</a> way.<br><br>

    <p class="base diversity">Or maybe not.</p><br>

    <p class="base">Maybe you feel at one with the <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">planet</a>, and think it’s more important to give back all the care and nourishment we received so far. You value <a class="ad" href="/cooperation#diversity">beauty</a> and <a class="ae" href="/cooperation#equivalence">happiness</a> as fundamental for everyone and everything.<br><br>

    Another possibility, instead, is that you are concerned about wars and hunger and see them as an effect of the way wealth is <a class="ae" href="/platform">distributed</a>. So you would like an economy based not on numbers, productivity and surplus only, but also on <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">caring</a>, sustainability, real assets, traditional shops and activities coordinated by “multilocal” companies. You may be wanting safe and fair water access, healthy food, recyclable materials and traditional processes instead of harmful excessive <a class="ad" href="/cooperation#diversity">standardizations.</a><br><br>

    Or maybe, instead, you’ve just been looking for a way to make your <a class="ae" href="/participate">daily little effort</a> valuable to bring the changes you wish for.<br><br>

    All these are different beliefs, but together, they can create a wealthy and enjoyable social ecosystem. Your belief becomes even more crucial when seen together with the other ones.<br><br>
