      You may <span class="diversity">love</span>
      <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">doing things together</a>.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="base">
      You could be one who believes that doing things together is advantageous
      and useful to bring a real change, but you would like to do it keeping a
      <a class="af" href="/cooperation#freedom">personal space for yourself</a
      >.<br /><br />

      Or you may be one of those who believe that
      <a class="ae" href="/platform">changing the world</a> starts with a new
      <a class="au" href="/cooperation">awareness</a>.<br /><br />

      For example, you may believe in
      <a class="au" href="/science">science</a> and technology but want them to
      be respectful of the people’s
      <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">feelings</a>.<br /><br />

      Maybe you don’t want to be constantly influenced in your
      <a class="af" href="/governance">decisions</a>. You want to follow your
      true desires, making your abilities meet your professional
      <a class="af" href="/cooperation#freedom">life</a>. You probalby dream
      about a social system that
      <a class="ad" href="/integration">integrates</a> the different
      personalities of everyone in a creative and balanced way.<br /><br />

      You could be looking for an open world, where you’re not afraid to be
      <a class="ai" href="/cooperation#transparency">honest</a> all the time
      because people and institutions agree to share information in a
      <a class="ae" href="/cooperation#transparency">transparent</a>
      way.<br /><br />
    </p>

    <p class="base diversity">Or maybe not.</p>
    <br />

    <p class="base">
      Maybe you feel at one with the
      <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">planet</a>, and think it’s more
      important to give back all the care and nourishment we received so far.
      You value <a class="ad" href="/cooperation#diversity">beauty</a> and
      <a class="ae" href="/cooperation#equivalence">happiness</a> as fundamental
      for everyone and everything.<br /><br />

      Another possibility, instead, is that you are concerned about wars and
      hunger and see them as an effect of the way wealth is
      <a class="ae" href="/platform">distributed</a>. So you would like an
      economy based not on numbers, productivity and surplus only, but also on
      <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">caring</a>, sustainability, real
      assets, traditional shops and activities coordinated by “multilocal”
      companies. You may be wanting safe and fair water access, healthy food,
      recyclable materials and traditional processes instead of harmful
      excessive <a class="ad" href="/cooperation#diversity">standardizations.</a
      ><br /><br />

      Or maybe, instead, you’ve just been looking for a way to make your
      <a class="ae" href="/participate">daily little effort</a> valuable to
      bring the changes you wish for.<br /><br />

      All these are different beliefs, but together, they can create a wealthy
      and enjoyable social ecosystem. Your belief becomes even more crucial when
      seen together with the other ones.<br /><br />
