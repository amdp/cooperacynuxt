        Cooperacy is a nonprofit project aiming to support our social ecosystem
        fostering the enjoyment of cooperation: on a more technical side, this
        is achieved transforming the current

        distribution of resources, decisions and activities into a more even

        The
        <nuxt-link to="/platform" class="ai">Cooperacy Platform</nuxt-link> is
        the base of Cooperacy circular economic ecosystem. The participants
        voluntarily pool one euro per month into a common sum in order to fund
        their own ideas. The profits generated by these ideas goes back to the
        common pool. This triggers a co-owned virtuous process. To fund itself,
        Cooperacy offers also parallel services and activities:
        <nuxt-link to="/overview" class="ai">Cooperacy Overview</nuxt-link>
        is a measurement of the cooperation amount in larger organizations or
        institutions in order to promote their resilient growth. For example,
        the
        <nuxt-link to="/cci" class="ai">Cooperation Context Index</nuxt-link>
        shows the possibility of cooperation in most of the countries in the

        is the live application of the Cooperacy model. The participants of any
        organization or community can enjoy a natural social system able to
        generate collaboration, innovation and problem solving.<br /><br />
        <nuxt-link to="/research" class="ai">Cooperacy Research</nuxt-link> is
        instead a continuous scientific investigation about possible social
        systems based on cooperation and ecosystemic awareness.<br /><br />
        If you consider our society and its natural ecosystem as a whole living
        organism, being part of Cooperacy means supporting this organism with
        the enjoyment of cooperation.

                I'm a #gamification consultant. In Cooperacy I found that game
                design (and gamification) has a bad paradigm nowadays:
                cooperation is better (competition sucks ;-) ). As a game
                designer, accepting this fact was very hard for me. In game
                design and gamification, we have a lot of theories, techniques,
                and systems quoted on competition, a powerful drive in the human
                mind. Now with Cooperacy, We are trying to design games and ARGs
                to teach cooperation to high school students. And as an Iranian,
                I really love to test this gamified system to help my people.

                Cooperacy especially because its ideas are simpler to experience
                than to explain. There’s research in it, social research. And I

                Cooperacy there is a rainbow of personalities one different than
                another, all full of enthusiasm and energy, with which to share
                ideas and work together. In Cooperacy I found a lot of people
                who work together well, and that overall they have fun doing it."

                hierarchies, I have always wondered if the world I dreamed was
                the right one. Discussing with Alessandro and listening to the
                Cooperacy concept, I was intrigued by the thought that something
                could (and perhaps should) change compared to certain ideas,
                appreciating the innovative way in which the cooperation science
                interpreted models."

                environments come from the fact that every relationship starts
                with the presumption of knowing how to relate, communicate and
                cooperate. This presumption is false in almost all cases. We
                need courage, creativity and competence to change this
                condition, and Cooperacy has all the needed skills to accomplish
                it."

                to see what happens here. Without knowing if I will be able to
                be useful, but with that feeling that I want to understand

                common 'origin' able to make them to desire and recognize
                themselves in the actions they do everyday. They experienced the
                feeling of cooperation and naturally desired their social
                ecosystem to be based on redistribution of wealth, activities
                and power with proportional creative integration. In other
