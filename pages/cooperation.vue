      ACTING TOGETHER, WITH MUTUAL ENJOYMENT
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Cooperation means acting together with mutual enjoyment of everyone
      involved. A cooperation must also have neutral or positive effects on
      anybody or anything <i>external</i> to the interaction.<br />
      Cooperation is a specific dynamic that happens only when the context, or
      better the <i>social ecosystem</i>, allows it to emerge. It is an original
      circumstance from where different individual goals, or sometimes very
      similar desires, are fulfilled.<br /><br />
      According to our
      <nuxt-link to="/articles" class="au">scientific model</nuxt-link>, the
      social ecosystem in which cooperation may emerge should meet seven
      conditions.

    <p class="subheading diversity center space margin">WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT</p>
    <p class="base">
      Diversity is a pre-condition of cooperation that always exists in any
      ecosystem. It is also a <i>condition</i> because it
      <i>should not be inhibited</i>. Cooperation is different from fanaticism
      and homologation, where every individual must conform to a unique idea,
      lifestyle, cult, imagery or human mechanisation. Without diversity, we
      lose beauty and innovation. Standardised jobs or constrained life
      dynamics, like workers in the industrial revolution factories, inhibit the
      emergence of cooperation. Having
      <nuxt-link to="/fun" class="ad">fun</nuxt-link>, playing games and telling
      different, intimate stories helps the emergence and the possibility of
      cooperation.

    <p class="base">
      Diversity is a potential of conflict, but also a potential of development.
      Anthropologically mankind reached high levels of survival and wealth also
      thanks to the natural tendency to pursue and develop different personal
      skills, generating the possibility to have more
      <nuxt-link to="/integration#diversity" class="ad">roles</nuxt-link> and
      functions for every participant in the community. Probably we are the most
      diverse and role-differentiated creatures on earth.

    <p class="subheading diversity center space margin">PERSONALITIES</p>
    <p class="base">
      The acknowledgement of different preferences, personalities and roles in
      the community is needed to create a good climate: when individuals have
      their personal identity

      DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

      When diversity brings different linguistic, behavioural, and cultural

      CONFLICTUAL COLLABORATION
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Conflictual collaboration is a form of generic collaboration that often
      occurs in groups when there is very low information flow, social and
      cultural diversities with lack of acceptance of the differences, usually
      forcing them into orthodoxy or uniformity. We propose different
      <nuxt-link to="/integration#solutions" class="ad">solutions</nuxt-link> to
      a state of conflict, that may arise due to misunderstanding even between
      people who appreciate one another.

    <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">COMMON CODES</p>
    <p class="base">
      Learning the beauty of a different way to interpret the reality and
      enjoying the pleasure of the difference is a great cooperation drive.
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="ad">Integrating</nuxt-link> and
      explaining languages and cultures, personalities and habits, points of

      traditions and languages may be different, values like love,
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#care" class="ac">respect</nuxt-link>, safety
      or concepts like friendship, birth and parenthood can be strong common
      codes upon which we can build cross-diversity understanding. Enhancing
      empathy, the special common code of feelings, we can generate deep
      comprehension, leading everyone feel accepted and part of the community.
      All these concepts help cooperation to emerge together with mutual
      enjoyment.

    <p class="base">
      We can say there’s a generic collaboration even in slavery, imposition or
      manipulation, as people effectively do something together. They're not
      that happy, though. Lack of personal freedom, and absence of a personal
      choice in a generic collaborative interaction make it impossible to make
      it become a cooperation: there is no mutual enjoyment. To solve these kind
      of contextual issues, a good personal space or even
      <nuxt-link to="//integration#freedom" class="af">separation</nuxt-link>
      are needed, even in a nice cooperation.

    <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">OUR PERSONAL STORY</p>
    <p class="base">
      It is natural to find high levels of aggression and competition in
      contexts where there’s imposition or forced behaviour. On the other side,
      in social ecosystems where cooperation emerges, the freedom of choice is
      wide, and the enjoyment is high. Freedom is anyways a very complex
      subject. The most enlightening way to see freedom is the possibility to
      recognise ourselves, our preferences and our personal story in the choices
      we make during our lifetime. When cooperating, it is necessary to learn
      how to
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="ad"
        >proportionally and creatively integrate</nuxt-link
      >
      to balance freedom, care and equivalence.

    <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">SPACE</p>
    <p class="base">
      One of the most important expressions of freedom isn’t the possibility to
      do anything that comes up in our mind, but an adequate, balanced social
      context that allows personal space and access to services for everyone.<br />
      Once again, it is in the balance of the whole social ecosystem the secret
      that allows individual, intimate, personal freedom.

    <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">TRUTH OR CONTEXT?</p>
    <p class="base">
      Honesty is regarded as one of the most important values in many cultural
      contexts. However, truth is difficult to say and difficult to receive: it
      should be communicated with the right words and the right attitude.
      Transparency is related to <i>access to information</i>: this means that
      it is not our personal interpretation of truth that we want the other to
      have access to. Usually, instead of communicating the truth, it is better
      to communicate the
      <nuxt-link to="/integration#transparency" class="ai"
        >contextual point of view</nuxt-link
      >
      with which we see things now or made a choice before.

    <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">BETRAYAL</p>
    <p class="base">
      When transparency ends, frauds, hoaxes or reticence make apparent reliable
      collaborations to make us feel betrayed. If we have nothing to hide, why
      not being transparent? It is important to tell the conditions and the
      limitations we are currently evaluating in our personal position.
    </p>
    <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">FORGIVENESS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Do we want to know the truth to understand and take account of it or just
      to punish others if they made a mistake? Behind the exchange of personal
      information, and even of sensible data, there’s a great deal of
      acceptance. Most of us don’t say what they know or think just because they
      are afraid of the consequences. Only accepting the diversity of others we
      can see the reality behind the appearances. Being honest and transparent
      seems hard, but it is one of the ways in which you can change the world
      and your same personal life. The right social ecosystem usually has an
      embedded
      <nuxt-link to="/governance" class="ai">governance</nuxt-link> which

    <p class="subheading care center space margin">COORDINATION</p>
    <p class="base">
      The condition of "care" is related to coordination and respect of the
      social and natural ecosystems. When we receive services, like when we take
      a bus or a taxi, when our nations give us healthcare or educational
      facilities, when our families fulfill some of our needs or desires, when
      we hug each other, we receive care. Care means coordinating something
      needed by you with something needed by others. In our page
      <nuxt-link to="/aboutyou" class="ac">about You</nuxt-link>, we exposed
      what you may find in Cooperacy that meets your personality, in

    <p class="subheading care center space margin">EVERYONE AROUND YOU</p>
    <p class="base">
      Caring for others is a form of complex thinking that is able to generate
      mutual enjoyment. Usually care is not perceived as something fun or
      productive, but everyone of us needs and likes to receive attention. When
      respect and esteem are shared amongst everyone, productivity levels raise
      and even <nuxt-link to="/fun" class="ad">fun</nuxt-link> is better.

    <p class="subheading care center space margin">ECOSYSTEMS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Those interactions where there are common benefits but there is lack of
      respect or care can not be considered a cooperation: there are negative
      services that cut down the benefits and tend towards progressive damage or
      long-term loss.<br />
      Unhealthy workplaces and local or global damaged environment,
      psychological dependencies, absence of meritocracy, mobbing and in the
      worst cases violence can’t lead to the emergence of cooperation.<br />
      The natural ecosystem is the base for our social context to be pleasant.
      Humans, animals, plants, mountains, deserts and oceans: the whole planet
      is connected and every part of it is needed like the organs of your body.

    <br />

    <p class="subheading trust center space margin">WHAT IS TRUST?</p>
    <p class="base">
      When we are not respected or cared, we become mistrustful, because we
      developed a powerful evolutionary tool: trust. In neuroscience, trust is
      represented by the probability, based on similar or past events, that an
      interaction will be pleasurable in its results, called rewards. Rewards
      can be <nuxt-link to="/aboutyou" class="at">intrinsic</nuxt-link>, like
      something you personally like to do, or extrinsic, like when you like
      money just because <i>then</i> using money you will do something you like.
      When your rewards are mainly linear and extrinsic, that is, external to
      your self identity, you start to lose your native personality. You may
      even build up two or more contrasting selves, one who wants to live in the
      nature with few things and another one who wants to be rich and live in a
      skyscraper.<br />
      Trust in people can be intrinsic and extrinsic too. We may trust people
      intrinsically, when we really like them, and extrinsically, when we trust
      them according to the advantages they provide.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading trust center space margin">
      THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUST AND RELIABILITY
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      In the common language, and according to the different cultures, the word
      trust indicates both emotive connection and reliability. If I trust your
      values, your emotions, your personality, I trust in you. If you are
      reliable, I can count on you. So I can "emotively trust" you even if you
      are unreliable, because you are a person I "resonate with" and your being
      unrealiable is not intentional. In the opposite case I can count on you
      even if you’re not a friend of mine or someone I don't like: you are a
      reliable person and I can be sure of what we can agree on. These two kinds
      of trust are connected with two special kinds of rewards: real and
      relational benefits. Our idea of a cooperation
      <nuxt-link to="/platform" class="at">platform</nuxt-link> tries to address
      trust and reliability balancing both levels of benefits.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading trust center space margin">BETRAYAL AND FEAR</p>
    <p class="base">
      When we are betrayed we tend to feel anger and a desire of damaging the
      person we thought was worth of trust, because the opposite of trust is
      fear, and fear and compromised goals bring anger.<br />
      Social systems can be punitive, like dictatorship and totalitarianism, or
      overly based on benefits and performance, like extreme competitive
      money-making based societies. In that case the high risks generate fear,
      compromises our goals and brings subsequent anger. Having damaged
      intrinsic trust in people, individuals seek extrinsic trust and rewards.
      We look for friends who can give us benefits, not happiness, because
      without benefits we may suffer, be afraid or feel excluded from the social
      network. Trust is very important, because when people are afraid or
      mistrust others, conflicts may arise quite often. As you can imagine,
      trust depends on the whole social ecosystem balance and
      <nuxt-link to="/governance" class="af">governance</nuxt-link> for allowing
      the emergence of cooperation and mutual enjoyment.

    <p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">EQUALITY?</p>
    <p class="base">
      Equivalence is the simplest condition and evidence of cooperation.
      Everyone of us is different, but the idea that everyone is happy reminds
      us of beautiful moments of sharing where our happiness was even stronger
      because it was also in the eyes of the others around us. The idea of being
      "equal" seems right, but in reality it is not. If I am a little kid, I
      probably need a different meal compared to a woman or a man.<br />
      A kid meal, even if of less amount, is <i>equivalent</i> to a standard
      meal for a grown-up human. Kids may also prefer more sweets than adults,
      but shouldn't like a glass of wine. Diabetics may want the same sweets as
      their kids, but alas, they know it wouldn't be a good choice. Individuals
      and their diversity should be considered for equivalent benefits, not
      equal ones, in order to live <i>equivalent</i> lives.

    <p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">
      COOPERATION IS DIFFERENT THAN ALTRUISM
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Cooperation is different from altruism, solidarity and donation where we
      see a “recipient” that simply “gets” in a one-way action. It is easy to
      say that if you follow only your personal benefit, you are in the world of
      egoism. Sometimes, instead, you are only focused on giving and you forget
      about yourself. Cooperation is an equilibrium of the two, a situation in
      which you're selfish while being altruist -and feel happy about it.<br />
      Cooperation is complex: it is way more than the simple idea of giving or
      getting and emerges when the two actions find their

      BENEFITS AND RELATIONS
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Equivalence is not a mere accounting of things. You may enjoy food, a new
      car, but also a good friendship. An equivalence of real benefits is found
      when anybody gets equivalent goods, services or valuables as the other
      participants. An equivalence of relational benefits, instead, happens when
      you are as averagely happy as the other participants are. The first one is
      good, it is usually called a win-win, but it is not enough. Cooperation is
      not a mere goods and services exchange, but a pleasant relational exchange
      too. These are the base concepts we rely on in our
      <nuxt-link to="/platform" class="ae">platform</nuxt-link>.<br />
      Cooperation emerges -and it has its evidence- when in a social ecosystem
