    <p class="subheading freedom center">I - THE GATHERING</p>
    <p class="base">
      In a participants circle, a facilitator asks people to listen to their
      feelings and to express any concerns to the
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#care" class="ac">context</nuxt-link>
      surrounding them. The facilitator also explains the Journey Narrative to
      the circle: the present situation is shown with all the
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#freedom" class="af">limitations</nuxt-link>,
      the efforts done so far and the positive outcomes. The meeting continues
      with describing what would have happened in the future if the
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ad">preferences</nuxt-link>
      and desires of the participants would come true. Every desire is turned
      into a proposal. This leads to the ideas ecosystem.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="subheading freedom center">II - THE ECOSYSTEM</p>
    <p class="base">
      The people start going to the center of the circle in order to express
      their ideas or to share
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#transparency" class="ai"
        >informations</nuxt-link
      >
      by topics. In case of a two-days event, an informative day comes before a
      final ideas day. The ideas or the informative topics are written on a
      common board with a time and a space in which they will be discussed. The
      group is "dissected" and "dies" according to a specific narrative, story
      or myth. Its parts form new groups and circles. Now and then an
      "exploration reshuffle" is performed. Coordination and diffusion of
      knowledge are the transformation tools to solve the exposed problems and
      the current limitations.

      is spread through the participants. The ideas proposed are listed and
      voted according to: costs and benefits; personal trust; emotional power;
      transparency; participants commitment; understandability; innovation and
      creative power of the idea, following the seven conditions of
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation" class="ae">cooperation</nuxt-link>. From the
      voting review a future agenda is made based on a common dictionary, a
      redistribution of workload and resources and a common roadmap.<br /><br />
      When the organisation need is to use a more quantitative or reflexive
      approach on a larger scale, without the need of a live event, observing
      both the people in different locations and their data, the
      <nuxt-link to="/overview" class="af">Overview</nuxt-link> tool is a better
      choice.
