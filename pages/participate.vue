    <p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">THE PLATFORM</p>
    <p class="base">
      Our main effort is to finish the development of our ideas
      <a class="ae" href="/platform">platform</a>. We have trialled some
      activities which have created surplus and this has been returned to the
      Cooperacy pool. We invite members to propose further ideas that will
      stimulate sustainable surplus growth. Although we have already made some
      testing we still have to reach 3000 members to make the platform
      appealing, dynamic and sustainable. This is our first milestone, to get
      more participants: we are currently aroud 50, coming from Italy, Germany,
      United States, Brazil, Iran!

      COOPERACY MESSENGERS
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Our communication group needs new members to help with the texts, the
      graphics, the translations and the front end coding. If you have any of
      these skills and you are willing to participate please
      <a class="ae" href="/register">join</a> and
      <a class="at" href="/contact">contact us.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">COOPERACY CODERS</p>
    <p class="base">
      If we had enough coders we would need a lot less than 3000 members to
      support and maintain the platform. If you would like to participate in an
      open project in which your experience will be of great value for the group
      while the final output will be a human centered designed tool to foster
      human cooperation, we are really happy to introduce you to our
      <a class="at" href="/contact">coding team</a>.

    <p class="base">
      Acroyoga merges acrobatic movements with simple yoga positions. It is
      based on the <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">cooperation</a> and

      one supervisor. The cooperation in this case is based on how the bodies

      <a class="au" href="/cooperation#understanding">understanding</a> of the
      participants. It is an activity that highlights the values of Cooperacy
      and has been developed following the Cooperacy governance system.

      This project was led by Igor Carravetta and Carola Ravaschino in 2016.
      During one of the first Cooperacy meetings, we were discussing how to test
      the <a class="af" href="/governance">voting system</a> and do something
      together. The group voted and we funded and helped the weekly course from
      October to March. It has been an amazing experience. Igor and Carola are
      happy to start over, if you want just drop a
      <a class="at" href="/contact">line</a> asking for them.

      <span class="freedom">1.</span> In Milan we bought fruit and vegetables
      directly from direct sources. We sold them amongst our members and made 30
      Euros. This covered all expenses for the experiment including transport
      and people’s time.<br />
      <span class="freedom">2.</span> We have researched and found that we are
      able to organise and develop a business out of supplying delicious,
      organic, multi-cereal bread from Busto Arsizio. If you would like to drive
      this exciting project let us know!<br />
      <span class="freedom">3.</span> Experience has shown us that we are able
      to earn 100 Euros for each catering event we organise.<br /><br />
      As you can see, we have had fun experimenting. Would you like to test your
      own? <a class="at" href="/contact">Write us</a> so that we can talk
      together and organise how to do it!<br /><br />

      COOPERATION SCIENCE
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      This project is the first and most important one as Cooperacy was born
      from our scientific research about Cooperation.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Alessandro Merletti De Palo and Ilario Tito were friends since 35 years.
      In 2014 they met in Rome, at Bar della Pace, to talk about how much the
      social system needed a change. A serious talking amongst friends, the
      typical chat that ends there once you say goodbye. Instead, when
      Alessandro went back home, he kept on thinking about it. How do you call
      that special, enjoyable energy that you feel with your friends even when
      you do something useful? There was no specific emotion, but Alessandro
      thought about the word "<a class="ae" href="/cooperation">cooperation</a
      >". What is cooperation? Can we bring that emotion of doing things
      together with enjoyment at a worldwide level? He wanted to know more, but
      there was no "Faculty of Cooperation" or "Cooperation University". So he
      started with the simplest thing he could do. He looked for the word
      cooperation in the dictionary. There were many definitions, but none was
      clear. He started reading scientific articles about it, intertwining
      different disciplines. Game Theory, Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology,
      Economy, Evolutionary Biology, Linguistics, Anthropology, Neuroscience..
      there were many different approaches to the study of cooperation. Merging
      them together in a model, Alessandro called Ilario back and asked him to
      cooperate together and find eventual demonstration of the theory, in order
      to to introduce it at the MIT Collective Intelligence conference. Together
      with Maria Gisa Masia, Alessandro Mancinella, Mariangela Nitti, and Kanwar
      Ujjawal Singh they wrote a paper that was accepted at the conference.
      Since then, they participated to many other conferences around the world:
      this story tells the birth of the scientific model behind the idea of
      Cooperacy. That meeting grew into more than a great meeting between
      friends, it was the seed from which the rest of Cooperacy has grown from.
      Out of our own friendship we believe we can grow the enjoyment,
      satisfaction and contentment of Cooperacy world wide. Today we’re doing
      great with Cooperation Science! Our model was at two conferences by MIT in
      the US, and in 2017 we presented in Macao our international Cooperation
      Context Index by countries. Have a look at the
      <a class="au" href="/coscience">scientific</a> part of our website and, if
