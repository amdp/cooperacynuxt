      If you think your local community would benefit thanks to a local
      Cooperacy chapter, you can create your own. Just get in contact with other
      possible members and create a group. Then
      <nuxt-link to="/contact" class="ai">contact us</nuxt-link> to organise meetings or
      presentations in your local area. Slowly, you will be gathering committed
      people with which to spread cooperation and enjoy doing things together!
