    <p class="subheading freedom center">CAN WE MEASURE COOPERATION?</p>
    <p class="base">
      Cooperacy Overview is a methodology that allows to measure the conditions
      of <nuxt-link to="/cooperation" class="ae">Cooperation</nuxt-link> in your organisation
      in order to obtain a complete overview of your social ecosystem. This
      would allow you to have a deeper
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#understanding" class="au">understanding</nuxt-link> of your
      human resources interactions and how they could be improved in cooperation
      and ecosystemic terms.

    <p class="base">
      What could be the measure of
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#trust" class="at">Trust</nuxt-link> in your organization?
      What could measure the
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#freedom" class="af">Freedom</nuxt-link> to innovate amongst
      your people? What about your organisation
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#transparency" class="ai">Transparency</nuxt-link>? These and
      other kinds of <nuxt-link to="/cci" class="au">indexes</nuxt-link> may be identified in
      your social ecosystem in order to overview what changes could drive to a
      more balanced and growth-oriented performance.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">POSSIBLE ECOSYSTEMIC INTERVENTIONS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Once the Overview is completed, identifying the possible interventions
      becomes an easier task. Nevertheless, in order to apply the required
      changes, it is very important to respect the ecosystemic
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#care" class="ac">relations</nuxt-link> in order not to break
      their balances. The final step in the Cooperacy Overview methodology is
      therefore to schedule gradual transformations that may finally result in
      an organic evolution able to foster, together with the desired growth,
      mutual enjoyment in the human resources involved. The transformation
      proposed follow the Cooperacy Group's
      <nuxt-link to="/journey" class="au">Journey</nuxt-link> methodology.<br /><br />

      If you're instead interested in allowing your organisation to have a
