    <p class="base">
      Cooperacy Overview is a methodology that allows to measure the conditions
      of <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">Cooperation</a> in your organisation
      in order to obtain a complete overview of your social ecosystem. This
      would allow you to have a deeper
      <a class="au" href="/cooperation#understanding">understanding</a> of your
      human resources interactions and how they could be improved in cooperation
      and ecosystemic terms.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">CREATE YOUR OWN ORGANISATION INDEX</p>
    <p class="base">
      What could be the measure of
      <a class="at" href="/cooperation#trust">Trust</a> in your organization?
      What could measure the
      <a class="af" href="/cooperation#freedom">Freedom</a> to innovate amongst
      your people? What about your organisation
      <a class="ai" href="/cooperation#transparency">Transparency</a>? These and
      other kinds of <a class="au" href="/cci">indexes</a> may be identified in
      your social ecosystem in order to overview what changes could drive to a
      more balanced and growth-oriented performance.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">POSSIBLE ECOSYSTEMIC INTERVENTIONS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Once the Overview is completed, identifying the possible interventions
      becomes an easier task. Nevertheless, in order to apply the required
      changes, it is very important to respect the ecosystemic
      <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">relations</a> in order not to break
      their balances. The final step in the Cooperacy Overview methodology is
      therefore to schedule gradual transformations that may finally result in
      an organic evolution able to foster, together with the desired growth,
      mutual enjoyment in the human resources involved. The transformation
      proposed follow the Cooperacy Group's
      <a class="au" href="/journey">Journey</a> methodology.<br /><br />

      If you're instead interested in allowing your organisation to have a
      deeper <a class="au" href="/cooperation#understanding">knowledge</a> about
      Cooperation Science, <a class="ai" href="/contact">contact us</a> in order
      to organise a <a class="af" href="/workshops">workshop</a> in your
      headquarters or offices.
