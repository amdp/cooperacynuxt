      COOPERATION SCIENCE FROM A INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Humans live in a reality that is mainly observed by the physics
      perspective and its subsequent
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system"
        >complex system</a
      >
      approach. Being humans
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">life</a> forms,
      they are observed also by biology through
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics">genetics</a>.
      Furthermore, human consciousness allow self-observation within specific
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences"
        >behavioral sciences</a
      >, psychology, sociology, anthropology and etology. Human cooperation may
      show similarities with that of other animals, even if some
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality"
        >eusocial</a
      >
      behaviors may show important differences, like those found in the
      <a class="au" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-we-cooperate"
        >primatology</a
      >
      field. As part of current society, they interact at a social level with
      economic and
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory"
        >governance</a
      >
      aspects that are also part of scientific investigations and simplified
      models like those of
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"
        >game theory</a
      >
      and
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model"
        >agent-based</a

      modeling. Human languages
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle"
        >semantics</a
      >
      may contain hints of their communication processes, and be a prelude to
      the findings about cooperation at a philosophical level. Neuroscience may
      help to explain cooperation as an
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a>
      complex phenomenon coming out from the interaction of basic
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"
        >rewards</a
      >
      seeking. From the neuroscience of rewards, necessary to human survival, we
      can go back to evolutionary biological behaviors and to physics- and
      <a class="au" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics"

      >-related elimination of local

      >.<br />
      Thus, when observing the human interaction called cooperation we start
      from a system approach that is investigated also with the help of all the
      above mentioned disciplines.<br /><br />

    <p class="base">
      The Cooperation Science model proposed compares the results of these
      different disciplines. We are about to release the first edition of this
      investigation, that specifically combines a general framework with the
      mentioned semantic, evolutionary biology, game theory, and neuroscience
      based approaches. We would also like to provide a subsequent economic
      model for a social system based on cooperation science.
