      Hello! Welcome to Cooperacy’s conflict resolution game. First of all,
      let’s meet Deasty, the “group beast” or the “spirit of the context”,
      representing the possibility of destruction and of good distribution or
      harmony. Deasty is a nice entity, but if something is umbalanced, Deasty
      tends to grow too much: little mistakes and misunderstandings will become
      unbearable by the humans who are doing something together. [Hi Deasty!] 2.
      Now, Deasty represents your group and your context or environment. It is
      like one person more. Now, let’s add to the context all the people
      involved, or, if you are considering a social ecosystem, all the
      communities, parties, cities, nations involved. If you are evaluating
      alone, feel free to add the answers yourself. If you want the others to
      answer as well, add their email after their name. We will ask them the
      same questions. Name: [……..] Name: [……..] [Add another] 3. Ok! Now we know
      there are Deasty, Girl, Guy, Friend and Bubu. It is 4+1 people. You will
      be asked some questions to understand both your point of view and that of
      Deasty. You want to start analysing the situation or resolving the
      conflict directly? [Analyse] [Resolve] 1A Very well, you choose to
      analyse. As you know, Cooperacy is based on seven dimensions. We will
      start with Diversity and Inclusion: Personal preferences are respected?
      Girl No Somewhat Yes Guy No Somewhat Yes Firend No Somewhat Yes Bubu No
      Somewhat Yes The whole group No Somewhat Yes Does Girl feel Girl’s whole
      group preferences are generally respected? No Somewhat Yes Does Girl think
      Girl’s personal identity is listened and acknowledged? Does Girl think
      Girl’s whole group identity is listened and acknowledged? Does Girl
      recognise themselves in the group they are part of? Does Girl think the
      whole group recognise themselves as a group? 1R
