    <p class="base">Hello! Welcome to Cooperacy’s conflict resolution game.

      First of all, let’s meet Deasty, the “group beast” or the “spirit of the context”, representing the possibility of destruction and of good distribution or harmony. Deasty is a nice entity, but if something is umbalanced, Deasty tends to grow too much: little mistakes and misunderstandings will become unbearable by the humans who are doing something together.

      [Hi Deasty!]

      2.
      Now, Deasty represents your group and your context or environment. It is like one person more. Now, let’s add to the context all the people involved, or, if you are considering a social ecosystem, all the communities, parties, cities, nations involved. If you are evaluating alone, feel free to add the answers yourself. If you want the others to answer as well, add their email after their name. We will ask them the same questions.

      Name: [……..]
      Name: [……..] [Add another]

      Ok! Now we know there are Deasty, Girl, Guy, Friend and Bubu. It is 4+1 people. You will be asked some questions to understand both your point of view and that of Deasty. You want to start analysing the situation or resolving the conflict directly?

      Very well, you choose to analyse. As you know, Cooperacy is based on seven dimensions. We will start with Diversity and Inclusion:

      Personal preferences are respected?
      Girl No Somewhat Yes
      Guy No Somewhat Yes
      Firend No Somewhat Yes
      Bubu No Somewhat Yes
      The whole group No Somewhat Yes
      Does Girl feel Girl’s whole group preferences are generally respected? No Somewhat Yes
      Does Girl think Girl’s personal identity is listened and acknowledged?
      Does Girl think Girl’s whole group identity is listened and acknowledged?
      Does Girl recognise themselves in the group they are part of?
      Does Girl think the whole group recognise themselves as a group?
