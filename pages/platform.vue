    <p class="subheading transparency center space">IMAGINE</p>
    <p class="base">
      Imagine the effect of one million people bringing together a little
      economic effort: one euro. Imagine you and all the other people to
      reciprocally collect one million euros every month to support your ideas.
      With this collective fund you will generate an innovative economy in which
      the more people will participate, the more the people's ideas will be
      realized.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="subheading transparency center space">CO-OWNING A PLATFORM</p>
    <p class="base">
      The Cooperacy Platform won't just realise the most desired ideas proposed
      by the participants, but also create a social ecosystem based on
      co-ownership and redistribution of wealth. Every participants will in
      facts be co-owner of all the platform achievements and funds.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading center space transparency">VOTING IDEAS</p>
    <p class="base">
      The platform distributes the common money and resources to the ideas
      according to how much they are desired by the participants. Expressing
      their <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ae">preferences</nuxt-link> through
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ae">transparent</nuxt-link> votes, the
      common collected money goes
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="ae">proportionally</nuxt-link> to the ideas
      according to how many votes they received. Keeping it simple: people
      propose <i>ideas</i>, <i>votes</i> allocate the common money.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading center space transparency">REDISTRIBUTING PROFITS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Every idea is co-owned, so when it produces wealth, its profits go back to
      the platform collected money, in order to fund other ideas and to create a
      virtuous circle that slowly generates resources for
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#equivalence" class="ae">everyone</nuxt-link>.

    <p class="subheading center space equivalence margin">
      A COOPERATION LEARNING ECOSYSTEM
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      An artificial intelligence will learn from all the
      <nuxt-link to="/science" class="au">data</nuxt-link> coming from the platform and
      suggest, in the long run, best practices in order to help the people to
      realise their ideas. Moreover, the participants can communicate their
      happiness, so that the "deep learning ecosystem" will base its suggestions
      not only on data, but also on the most human, irrational and personal
      information of all: mood.

      We would be very happy to see you on board. One euro per month is really a
      small effort to see how much can be done when we join our forces.<br /><br />
