    <p class="base">
      The Cooperacy governance is made of projects, that can have upprojects or
      subprojects. The main project is called Cooperacy. Every project is based
      on the most simple form of
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation" class="ae">cooperation</nuxt-link>: two or more people
      doing something together. <br />
      It is advised every project should have maximum 148 people and two
      coordinators. A single coordinator is considered provisory, while projects
      may also decide to elect everyone as coordinator to experiment diffuse
      governance.<br />
      Anytime, coordinators may resign, can be substituted upon the project
      participants’ will or candidates may propose themselves to become
      coordinators.<br />

    <p class="subheading freedom center space">DECISIONS</p>
    <br />
    <p class="base" style="width: 100%;">
      Coordinators may take direct decisions in their project. Only when their
      decision is publicly communicated it becomes effective. When they are in
      contrast or unsure about what decision to take, coordinators can ask
      advice to the participants or start a voting phase.<br /><br />

      Participants can propose decisions as well through voting or asking the
      coordinators for direct approval. The coordinators should abstain when
      they are the voting main subject.<br />
      Participants may also oppose the coordinators decisions. If the opposing
      participants are at least two<SUP>1</SUP>, the coordinators should
      proportionally and creatively
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="ad">integrate</nuxt-link> the opposition according
      to the seven <nuxt-link to="/integration#solutions" class="ae">solutions</nuxt-link> or
      alternatively start a voting phase.<br /><br />

      If just a single participants proposes or opposes, but nobody secondes,
      the single instance is recorded or, when possible, but not always,
      proportionally and creatively
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="ad">integrated</nuxt-link>.<br />

    <p class="subheading freedom center space">VOTING</p>
    <br />
    <p class="base">
      Cooperacy is a design democracy: we vote project ideas first, people
      afterwards. Decisions are voted independently from the people who will
      enact them, as they will be chosen <i>on a second step</i>.<br /><br />
      The voting can be anonymous during the voting phase, but becomes
      transparent once the results are shown. All voting results are
      transparent.<br /><br />
      The decision making is based on approval voting, that is, everyone may
      vote with a single vote all the project ideas or alternative decisions
      they want. If there is not a clear orientation<SUP>2</SUP> after the
      voting phase, the participants leave their choice to the coordinators.
      They may also choose with the coordinators which one of the seven possible
      <nuxt-link to="/solutions" class="af">solutions</nuxt-link> to apply for the realization
      of the project’s will:<br /><br />
      - Turns or experimentations, starting from the most voted<br />
      - Give a definite time to test the previous situation and then vote
      again<br />
      - Change the context and pleasantness of the context or the voting process
      and vote again<br />
      - Retrieve more information, listen to all the people positions and decide
      again<br />
      - Separate the project in new ones, splitting eventual budgets<br />
      - Evaluate things through data, common values or objective criterias and
      vote again<br />
      - Combine using the
      <nuxt-link to="/integration" class="af">proportional creative integration</nuxt-link>
      the different solutions or give people -or the same solutions- specific
      roles<br />

    <p class="t16 just">
      1: DUAL COORDINATION The idea of a coordinating pair came up in order to
      avoid power to be concentrated in just one person, that receives huge
      responsibilities and is alone in facing them, or in more than two people,
      that may generate internal conflictual groups or collusions. Collective
      coordination is also possible, although roles could emerge anyways.<br />
      2: VOTING IS INFORMATIVE The voting results are indicators of the
      participants will, they do not explicitly determine a final decision,
      because winning and losing the voting process is substituted by
