    <p class="base">
      The Journey is a <a class="af" href="/aboutyou">personal</a> adventure
      that flows through the
      <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">conditions of cooperation</a> realms.
      When you <a class="ae" href="/register">join</a> Cooperacy you can ask for
      a personal mentor that will guide you though the Cooperacy Journey and
      develop your cooperation skills. Together, you will follow the journey
      seven steps and learn together -your mentor is just a more experienced
      learner- the way for accomplishing a profound cooperation awareness and to
      better understand the Cooperacy project. You will learn how to "read"
      contexts and groups, how to bring important changes together and how to
      renovate the social ecosystemic balance around you. The Cooperacy Journey
      brings you in a new world, showing you a new way of reasoning, empowering
      your role in your organization, your community or your same social context
      in order to bring mutual benefits and multirelational balance.

      The Journey is also a path of growth for groups. In order to bring
      improvement and needed changes, the Cooperacy Journey provides a path that
      follows the seven conditions in order to bring forward all the group or
      organisation <a class="af" href="/services">development</a> power. Some
      companies that have strong rational or pyramidal structures need more
      equivalence to foster innovation through better internal services instead
      of leadership changes, while some institutions need more diversity or
      freedom to shake a little bit the recurring or stagnant processes they
      face. Family and small groups may need to improve their strange
      information and decision flows. The Cooperacy Journey follows the same
      path for learning dedicated group methodologies that bring better

    <p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">A GROUP ADVENTURE</p>
    <p class="base">
      The Cooperation Journey is a path through the many relations we have
      within our social groups, even at a personal level. Feeling like a team,
      and feeling different groups as a bigger team is thinking in an
      ecosystemic way. The group's journey is therefore one of the best
      adventure we can do to improve our personal and "ecosystemic" selves: the
      outcome is to become aware of the surrounding social and natural
      ecosystem, to release tensions where we are damaging our possibility to
      enjoy our lives, to respect the different nuances everyone of us has, be
      it the family, the friends, the colleagues or the world's level, and to
      focus on our intimate desires as part of the community improvements. At
      the end of the Journey new
      <a class="ad" href="/integration">integration</a> tools and a new
      awareness will bring fresh energy and new possibilities for the best of
      the personal self, the social groups and even the natural ecosystem.<br /><br />
