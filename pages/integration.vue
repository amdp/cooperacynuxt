      LEARNING TO COOPERATE MEANS LEARNING TO INTEGRATE
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Most conflictual situations are generated by different perspectives that
      polarize losing their
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ad">potential</nuxt-link>.<br />A little
      amount of contrast is useful and even good sign, but when it turns into
      conflict, you experience direct or indirect, verbal or physical violence.
      In that case you tend to polarize, that is, to defend your position as you
      would if you were under a death menace. We found interesting
      <nuxt-link to="/integration#solutions" class="ad">solutions</nuxt-link> to conflictual
      interactions, but you can generally use
      <i>proportional creativity integration</i> as a rule of thumb.

      CREATIVITY EVOLVES CONTRAST
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Proportional creativity integration needs training as we're used to
      address situations with another different approach, the win/lose one, in
      which the winning position is the only one respected. In proportional
      creativity you first establish a criteria -that could be voting or
      weighting opportunities- to measure situations, and then try to creatively
      integrate the diverse perspectives. There is not a standard recipe (..for

      INTEGRATION NARRATIVES
    </p>

    <!-- insert kitchen image here -->

    <p class="base">
      The first story is a simple one. In a company office, people want to use
      the kitchen zone for different purposes. Some want to use it as the
      standard lunch zone for the workers. Other people think cooking courses
      may be organized while some few other ones say they would use the
      colourful kitchen as an office. Three different views clashing one against
      another. Proportional space and time may solve the situation. The majority
      will use it as the lunch area, while the third group can use a
      proportional office space during working hours. Cooking workshops instead
      will be held in the weekend when nobody is working.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading understanding space center margin">CONTEXT</p>

    <!-- insert ancient library image here -->

    <p class="base">
      Another famous example tells of an ancient library, during summertime.
      It's very hot, a man opens a window, but a girl blocks him as that window
      is facing a restaurant: noise and various smells would fill the library
      and defocus the readers.<br /><br />
      The man insists and the two start to argue, conflict is near.. How would
      you solve this situation?<br /><br />
      Suddenly the librarian stopped the two, closed the window and.. opened
      another one on the other side of the library, allowing fresh air to enter
      with no noise nor cooking smells.<br />
      Once you know the context, creativity arises and
      <nuxt-link to="/integration#solutions" class="ad">solutions</nuxt-link> are found in the
      integration of opposite, clashing but right perspectives.

      Contrast between ideas or people is part of the game, conflict is when
      contrast escalates into a form of violence. Equivalence, Trust, Care,

      EQUIVALENCE: TURNS AND EXPERIMENTATION

      Allow experimentation and use turns so that different proposed solutions
      have their space and
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#equivalence" class="ae">equivalent</nuxt-link> importance.
      Enjoy the way others would do things: you will learn how they think.

      TRUST: TIME AND EVALUATION
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      Give time its pace. Allow experience and adaptation to fix the situation
      and evaluate the results after a given amount of time. Sometimes fear may
      make people think in a negative way about events in the future. Faith in
      your solution and in those of others allows things to set up.
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#trust" class="at">Trust</nuxt-link> is important also in
      evaluations: when you see the solution tested has evidently damaged the
      group for a relevant amount of time, it will be easier to agree to a
      change.

      CARE: BETTER CONTEXTS, BETTER FEELINGS
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#care" class="ac">Care</nuxt-link> means respect and good
      coordination. The context, the environment and the services should be
      observed. Are you in a beautiful place? Are plants or animals respected
      around you? Are there colors? Is there good food and water? Are you
      feeling good? Are you tired and need a pause? Are you afraid of something?
      Are you happy instead? Can you find an area of your body in which that
      happiness is?<br />
      These questions seem to be a lot but they are very important. They can
      create a funny and bright mood and give you time to relax a bit and be
      more comprehensive with each other.

      TRANSPARENCY: CONTEXTUAL POINT OF VIEW
    </p>
    <p class="base">
      The trick here is to expose everyoneâ€™s point of view in complete freedom.
      Be careful with this methodology and be ready to accept apparent
      unpleasant aspects. Bear very well in mind that what is requested is not
      to tell the truth right away, but to clearly expose
      <i>the contextual situation</i> from which your point of view
      <i>desumes</i> the truth you are going to expose. Saying "The wall is
      white" is different than saying "In my video camera, I see the blue wall
      as completely white."<br /><br />

      the minimum you need to be comfortable in the current situation and what
      are the limitations you face in your position. Also, express your desires
      in first person, trying to be specific as much as you can. For example, a
      sentence like "You don't listen to me" becomes "I feel like as I am not
      able to be understood. I would really like if I could talk for 5 minutes,
      no more, without interruption."

      try a pause or simply some space or distance between the people in

      UNDERSTANDING: COMMON CODES

    <p class="base">
      Ask yourself what are the values you believe in when you have a contrast.
      The values or the motivations could be profoundly similar even in a wide
      difference of personal views. Choose together common and measurable
      criterias to evaluate the situation. Everyone of us is
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ad">different</nuxt-link>, and everyone of
      us sees things with a different perspective, trying to be happy in this
