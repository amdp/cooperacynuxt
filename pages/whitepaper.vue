        This white paper explains how the Cooperacy platform works in detail.
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        The platform is intended to develop the comembers ideas. Cooperacy is
        the platform largest project, a real ecosystem. Any internal activity of
        Cooperacy is a project as well. Every project can be a part of other
        ones, or their home. All activities generated by the platform are
        coowned by Cooperacy and its comembers.

        Cooperacy <i>collection fund</i> is an amount of money generated by

      <!-- PROJECTS -->
      <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">PROJECT IDEAS</p>
      <p class="base">
        The money is allocated to the different ideas coming from the
        participants through their voting. Every second the microeuros are
        pre-allocated proportionally to the project ideas: the more the votes,
        the more the proportional amount of money. The collected funds are
        pre-allocated until the ideas budget is reached. When it happens, the
        idea turns into an "approval project" starting the budget release phase.
        After the approval phase is completed, the idea becomes an "active
        project", and its profits go back to the collection fund.
      </p>

      <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">FREE PROJECTS</p>
      <p class="base">
        Ideas may need no budget. For example, they can be a tool for a decision
        making supported by voting. Some of them, instead, like courses,
        concerts, dinners, parties.. may not require a budget but a minimum
        number of participants that commit themselves to the payment of a ticket
        or a fee, without which the ideas are not sustainable. All these ideas
        do not participate to the collection fund distribution, but their
        possible profit goes to the collection fund anyways, as all activities
        are co-owned by Cooperacy.
      </p>

      <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">
        AFTF MULTIDIMENSIONAL VOTING
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        In Cooperacy we don't vote for people, but for ideas. Both ideas and
        voting are anonymous until the ideas become projects. After that, all
        the information will be transparent for checking purposes. This is
        called AFTF, Anonymous First, Transparent Forever-after: the beginning
        anonymity allows to boost collective intelligence and transparency
        enhances cooperation afterwards. <br />
        Anybody can vote for as many ideas they want. In order to leverage more
        collective intelligence, there are different kinds of votes:
      </p>
      <br />
      <!-- VOTING -->
      <p class="base equivalence">Equivalence</p>
      <p class="base">
        It determines the proportional allocation of funds from the money pool.
        Technical: the proportions are calculated with the number of the
        equivalence votes the idea has (Ei), divided by the total (Et) of all
        the equivalence votes all the ideas have (Ei / Et ). If funds for a
        budget project idea get to more than 50%, the project gets to a boost
        bonus and its funding allocation will be as quick as if it had 80% of
        the votes. Equivalence votes in a "free project" indicate participation
        as a client, that is, affiliate, pre-buy, subscription to a course or
        pre-purchase to a concert. This vinculates the trustee to the payment of
        the relative pre-purchase or fee when the project becomes active.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="base trust">Trust</p>
      <p class="base">
        Trust votes make the project skip the human resources budget step.
        Technical: if the project trust votes (Ti) are more than 75% of the
        project equivalence votes (Ti > 75% Ei) the human resources budget step
        is automatically approved.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="base care">Care</p>
      <p class="base">
        When care-voted, the project gains more visibility. Technical: Ideas
        visibility is enhanced by ordering them by Care. This emotional response
        in the future could also be generated thanks to biofeedback sensors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="base transparency">Transparency</p>
      <p class="base">
        This is a downvote to declare hidden information, corruption, cheating
        or spamming. Technical: Transparency-voting triggers a message in which
        you communicate what others do not see. If a Transparency vote is
        "unvoted", the project may go into a "pairing" state where the
        participants discuss. After 90 days of pairing, if nothing happens the
        idea may be split or removed and in case the budget is turned back to
        the money pool. During this period the participants can better explain
        to unvoters the project idea development in order to restore
        transparency. If the idea is unblocked, the count of 90 days is
        canceled. Transparency voters are never anonymous. Highest
        transparency-unvoted projects may win the joke/trolling prize of the
        year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="base freedom">Freedom</p>
      <p class="base">
        Freedom-voting means you would like to work for the idea or participate
        into the decision making. Every project can instead be discussed and
        observed in full transparency anyways. Technical: if a hudget is
        requested, freedom-votes count for the requested hudget. Moreover,
        freedom-voters will be chosen automatically unless their number is
        higher than the requested hudget, in which case a selection will occur.
        If a hudget is not requested, the idea participants will first review
        the freedom-voters list for the budget "hudget" step. Freedom-voters
        automatically become participants when the project becomes active.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="base understanding">Understanding</p>
      <p class="base">
        This vote refers to the idea comprehension or nerditude and
        automatically approves the Setup phase. Technical: if the
        understanding-votes are above the 75th percentile (Ui > Ût + Ût/2) the
        Setup budget release step is automatically approved.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="base diversity">Diversity</p>
      <p class="base">
        When a project has a strong “bizardry” (diversity-votes), it has more
        opportunities to be randomly approved. Technical: ideas has a diversity
        percentage ( Di / Dt ). Every idea, the first day of a season (equinoxes
        and solstices), is given a random percentage value between 0% and 10%,
        to which the diversity percentage is added and then randomly multiplied
        by -1. The idea that has the highest “Bizardry” has a virtual added
        equivalence-votes percentage of +50% [( Ei + 50% Et ) / Et ]. Warning:
        10 diversity votes lower the equivalence ones by 1.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p class="base">
        Current minimum budget for funded ideas is 1000 euros, as according to
        crowdfunding sites statistics ideas with lower amounts averagely
        fail.<br />
        Any direct donation to an idea counts as dedicated donated budget.
        Donated budget and pre-allocated budget count for the idea budget to be
        turned into an approval project, but donated budget cannot be returned
        to the collection fund unless the idea is rescinded or abandoned.<br />
        Once the idea has reached the budget and/or hudget, the participants of
        the idea are kept frozen during the approval project phase until it is
        turned into an active project. The budget release milestones deadlines
        are chosen according to the Cooperacy
        <nuxt-link to="/governance" class="af">governance</nuxt-link>
        scheme.<br />
        Eventual contrasts not resolved in the 7 budget milestones are solved
        with a transparent voting kept live for three days, in which the
        participants can change their votes. The coordinators have three more
        days to try to creatively integrate the contrasting positions according
        to the seven solutions. At the end of a week time, the milestone should
        be decided.<br />
        All the contrasting votes not integrated reduce the budget, which goes
        back to the collection fund. In that case, the project turns back to the
        idea state, keeping the milestones approved, and waits again for the
        fulfilment of the missing budget cut due to contrasting positions.<br />
        Highlighting colors can indicate different ideas types, like cyan for
        “educational”, violet for “scientific”, and green for “environmental”
        ones. You are free to use these labels, but if they are misleading they
        can make people downvote them. Some projects are geographic units, like
        cities or specific locations and are highlighted in blue.<br />
        When an idea becomes an approval project, the idea is “born”, and has a
        birthdate. When the approval becomes an active project it can receive a
        three level feedback by the comembers (+,=,-).<br />
        In case of “death” of an active project, for example when a course ends,
        or a backery is sold, its final step is to be archived. This turns the
        active project into an archived one and the AI analyzes it while the
        participants may still give some feedback.<br />
        Participants Gender (M / F / Other) will be aggregated in order to
        inidicate in the future the project gender composition.<br />
        Projects may have internal project ideas, for example a language
        institute that wants to add a new language course. Budget ideas that
        want to be funded by the Cooperacy collection fund must be in the
        Cooperacy base project to receive any budget pre-allocation. Only
        afterwards they can be inserted as subprojects of any main project.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">CO-DONATIONS</p>
      <p class="base">
        Co-donation is an alternative way in which you can help an idea to find
        its budget. When you hit on co-donate, you choose a maximum amount you
        are willing to donate for filling up the idea budget, if all the other
        co-donators are willing to donate the same. The system periodically
        evaluates the lowest of all amounts promised and multiplies for the
        number of the co-donators in order to see if the total budget is
        reached. If not, the system evaluates other combination possibilities
        able to reach the budget, like excluding lower donation amounts. Once a
        possible co-donation is found, the idea is turned into a project and the
        codonations are billed to your bank account, credit card or any other
        possibility the website allows.
      </p>

      <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">
        BUDGET RELEASE STEPS
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        The budget release process is divided into 7 steps which have a three
        days approval voting time in which the process could be halted and the
        people in charge can be changed for corruption or security reasons. Only
        people who equivalence-voted, participated or are relative to the module
        will be notified of the phases. Participants are therefore allowed to
        vote even if they are external to the module but only if they really
        care, as they won’t be notified otherwise. Every step is also voted for
        its transparency and sustainability.

        THE COOPERACY PROJECTS AS MODULES
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        As you see, there is a modular design in the projects. The modularity
        allows for an organic and circle-like approach that is able to create
        open source blueprints for the whole platform community. Any project can
        have a "home" and internal "parts".<br />
        Every module has:<br /><br />
        1. Information set
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        • Title (and proposers when anonymity ends) <br />
        • Representative image <br />
        • Subheading or objective of the project<br />
        • Home and parts<br />
        • Tags<br />
        • Location<br />
        • Voting allowance (for specific local projects)<br />
      </p>

      <p class="base">
        2. Coordinators: the ears of the module, they listen to what the
        participants want to do and execute it.<br />
        3. Participants: active hands of the module. Minimum 2, the
        coordinators, advised maximum 150.<br />
        4. Experts: possible special participants who do not vote but give
        advices. The “mouth” of the module.<br />
        5. Reporters: two “eyes” of the module, they write reports and compare
        the module with the business plan.<br />
        6. Hudget: the number of committed people required to realize the
        module.<br />
        7. Feed: the module is continuously subject of feedback by the
        participants and the voters. Even after years any participant can decide
        if something was good or bad, influencing the memory of the system. A
        simple feedback history is available: after 1 month (M), 1 season (S), 1
        year (Y) and after 7 years (7).<br />
        Feedback can be only of three kinds: HAPPY(+) MEDIUM(=) SAD(-)<br /><br />
        The projects represent the voting unit of Cooperacy. They have this main
        lifecycle:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="base">
        • Project Idea: the project is proposed – it is usually anonymous and it
        could be also voted anonymously<br />
        • Approval Project: the idea reaches its budget or hudget, becomes a
        project, anonymity ends, budget phase starts;<br />
        • Active Project: the project becomes an active one, its profits go back
        to the collection fund;<br />
        • Archived Project: when the mission is accomplished or terminated the
        project “dies”. This is not a bitter end, it means the project goes in
        the archive in order to influence future modules and for future
        reference;<br />
