      The
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation" class="ae">cooperation</nuxt-link>-based
      hackathon represents the next step of the classic hackathon. In the
      classic version the company or the organization invites several developers
      and designers to create an application based on the some specific
      briefing. The participants compete either alone or in teams to win a prize
      in a given time. They are requested to show an alpha demo of their
      innovative application. The award is assigned by an external jury or
      directly by the client itself. Nevertheless, the competitive aspect of the
      hackathon has the negative effect to make all the losing participants
      disappointed and unwilling to share the event outcome, while

      In the Cohackathon the competitive side is used only in the selection of
      the best ideas. Being a transparent process, sometimes this can lead to an
      <nuxt-link to="/main/integration" class="ad">integration</nuxt-link> that
      makes more ideas to merge and become more powerful. The realisation of the
      prototypes and the final presentation are developed by everyone who wants
      to continue after the idea selection. The final award will be collectively
      achieved and distributed among the participants, who will celebrate
      together the common accomplishment.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">THE PLEASURE OF HACKING TOGETHER</p>
    <p class="base">
      The Cohackathon leverages on the full
      <nuxt-link to="/diversity" class="ad">diversity</nuxt-link> potential of
      the present participants. The same innovation output of the hackathon, if
      not even more, is achieved, with the advantage to focus all the available
      resources on the ideas development and realisation. Avoiding a single
      winner, moreover, generates a satisfactory feeling in all the attendants,
      which participate in the future dissemination of the output.<br /><br />
      When the company does not need an application solving its specific
      indications right away, a different, live, open meeting is possible: the
