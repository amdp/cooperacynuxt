    <p class="subheading transparency space">POLICY AND AGREEMENTS</p><br>

    <p class="base">All the participants of Cooperacy -including those of any of its Ideas or Cooperations - want to respect everyone’s privacy and applicable data protection and privacy laws. The dream is about a world in which every information is shared with no harm, but the path to that ideal has to respect the intimate needs and desires of everyone. So Cooperacy process created by humans are designed in a way that takes care of these aspects, starting from the communication of this privacy policy (“Policy”). It tells how Cooperacy, that is made of all of its participants, behaves as “data controller” and uses personal data every time this Policy is mentioned. “Personal data” means information about an identifiable individual. If there are special differences about a specific Cooperacy Cooperation Policy that differ from this Policy, the Cooperation Policy will list them. The differences will substitute this very Policy only in the cases or points listed in the Cooperation Policy. When there is the possibility to choose wether to give or not personal information, Cooperacy will make it explicit, so that anybody will be able to freely choose according to their preferences. Software on any device may access personal information. Cooperacy products or services may link to other companies’ websites and services that have privacy policies of their own. Cooperacy and its participants are not responsible for the privacy practices of others and it is recommended to read their privacy notices. If there is disagreement with this Policy, use of Cooperacy products and services or providing Cooperacy with personal data is discouraged, not in the scopes nor responsibility of Cooperacy. Cooperacy collect personal data and other information when a purchase is made, during use or registration into Cooperacy's products and services, participation in campaigns or research or during other interaction with Cooperacy. Cooperacy products and services may require electronic activation, asking data about device and application type and unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers. Access to Cooperacy services online or Cooperacy web servers automatically creates visit records. IP-address, access times, the sites linked from, pages visited, the links and features used, the content viewed or requested, browser or application type, language or other similar information are collected. Cooperacy applications may contact Cooperacy or other servers periodically, for example to check for updates or to send Cooperacy information relating to service usage. Additionally, Cooperacy may invite to join voluntary product and service improvement or research programs where detailed information is collected. Information is provided during the creation of an account, a purchase, a request for services, a participation in research or campaigns or generally during every interaction with Cooperacy. A possible non-exhaustive list may include name, email address, phone number, street address, user names and passwords, feedback, information relating to personal devices, age, gender, language, bank account number, credit card details and other financial sensible data. All this information is used by Cooperacy to fulfil the goals every participant chose to support, that are to have a common ecosystem based on cooperation, equivalence, trust, care, transparency, freedom, understanding and diversity-inclusiveness. Cooperacy therefore maintains records of consents, preferences and settings related to location data, marketing data, personal data, data sharing, et cetera. Cooperacy also maintain records of purchases, downloads, contents provided, requests, agreements, payment and delivery details, personal contacts and communications and other interactions with Cooperacy, including the products and services provided by Cooperacy. Cooperacy may, in accordance with applicable law, record any communications with the Cooperacy customer care or with other similar contact points. Location-based services establish location through the use of satellite, mobile, Wi-Fi or other network based positioning methods. These technologies may involve exchanging location data and unique device or mobile, Wi-Fi or other network related identifiers with Cooperacy. Cooperacy products may operate on multiple device platforms, applications and services which may also collect location data. Cooperacy never use any information to identify anybody personally without their consent. This Policy represents clear communication about what Cooperacy do with personal data, especially the participants’. When you use Cooperacy location based services and features, for example location based search, navigation and routing, or request for map data or other location data, personal data is sent to Cooperacy to serve the user with the right content, which may also include location based advertising. Marketing and advertising are used here as per the common international meaning, and not to avoid any responsibility about the communication related to privacy, although Cooperacy want to free the world from induced needs and actions, so Cooperacy's marketing and advertising strategies every time possible are avoided, when present, they are not based on numeric profit acquisition and mainly human-focused. The purpose of collecting personal data is simply to better understand human diversity and provide individual diversity with equivalent possibility to fulfil personal expectations, desires, needs, or, simply put, to take care of everybody’s personality in order to help participants to have a fulfilling and pleasant life. Personal data provides Cooperacy products and services the possibility to process requests or to perform the agreements between the participants and Cooperacy, to ensure the functionality and security of Cooperacy products and services, to identify who interacts with Cooperacy as well as to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses. Some services may require an account to help to manage content and preferences. Cooperacy may use personal data to better develop and manage products, services, customer care, sales and research. Cooperacy may combine personal data collected in connection with the use of a particular Cooperacy product and/or service with other personal data, unless such personal data was collected for a different purpose. Cooperacy may use personal data to communicate and inform, for example, services changes, notices or important alert relating to products and/or services, customer care related purposes, information about new products, services or functionalities, promotions, research, personalisations, recommendations, customised content, Cooperacy and possibly third party content. Cooperacy do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose personal data to third parties unless otherwise stated here or in the cooperations specifications and privacy Policies, in which case the procedure applies only if there is a clear consent to proceed. Some Cooperacy services may allow to share somebody personal data with other users or customers of the service or with other services and their users or customers. Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal data or other information that might be accessible to others. Cooperacy may share personal data with other Cooperacy companies, institutions or authorised third parties who process personal data for Cooperacy. Examples range from billing through network service providers, delivery of purchases, provision of services including customer services, consumer data management and analysis, credit checks, research, marketing and other similar operations. When purchasing, requesting or subscribing a Cooperacy product or service with a network service provider plan, Cooperacy may need to exchange information with the network service provider to provide the desired service. Cooperacy may conduct joint marketing and other communications with operation-relevant partners, for example a mobile operator. To avoid duplicate or unnecessary communications or to better communicate and inform Cooperacy may need to match information that has been collected with information that a partner has collected where this is permitted by law. These authorised third parties are not permitted to use personal data for any other purposes. Cooperacy require them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect personal data. Cooperacy products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where the services are requested or used, including to countries that do not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different legal rules on data protection. A simple transfer, for example, from the UE to the USA may have this characteristics. In such cases Cooperacy ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organisational information security measures. Cooperacy may be obligated by mandatory law to disclose personal data to certain authorities or other third parties, for example, to law enforcement agencies in the countries where Cooperacy or third parties acting on Cooperacy behalf operate or for national security reasons in the countries where products and services are object of interaction. Cooperacy may also disclose and otherwise process personal data in accordance with applicable law to defend Cooperacy’s legitimate interests, for example, in civil or criminal legal proceedings. If Cooperacy want to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise products, services or businesses in certain countries, this may involve disclosing personal data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisers. Cooperacy products and services are typically intended for general audiences. Cooperacy do not knowingly collect information of children without the consent of their parents or guardians.

To be clear: all ideas, comments, propositions, blueprints, images, works of art, intellectual properties, patents, inventions et cetera used in the Ideas proposals are property of Cooperacy at 50% and, once turned into Cooperations, become full property of Cooperacy. Rare and special exceptions may give the ownership to Cooperacy and to the user(s) in equal shares, where Cooperacy is the owner of half of the total shares (50%). The purpose in Cooperacy is to create a cooperative ecosystem in which people are rewarded for what they do but the profits are redistributed in the whole same ecosystem. Special rewards for inventors may be introduced by the participants. Every Idea proposal and subsequent Cooperation will state their special purposes in this respect.

      <p class="base">Cooperacy expect all of their participants and visitors to behave responsibly and help keep Cooperacy a nice place, a nice home, a nice social ecosystem. Don’t do any of these things on the Site:</p><br>
      <p class="base">How Cooperations Work</p><br>
      <p class="base">The Cooperacy Platform is a platform that turns cooperation ideas into active cooperations. </p><br>
      <p class="base">Cooperation ideas represent proposals, something that can be realized.</p><br>
      <p class="base">A cooperation is a part of Cooperacy. Being part of Cooperacy means being part of a circular and redistributive economy: all cooperations support one another in the wider ecosystem called Cooperacy. In legal terms, a cooperation may be incorporated in the Cooperacy institution, or have its legally independent name but still be a Cooperacy controlled external institution with its proper legal form.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Cooperation ideas</p><br>
      <p class="base">Cooperation ideas can be funded and have a budget to be reached to be turned into cooperations. The budget comes from the collection fund of Cooperacy, made by the single euro contribution of its participants and any donation received.</p><br>
      <p class="base">"0 funding" ideas do not need Cooperacy’s collection fund. They may be self-sustained ideas, participants-sustained ideas, co-funded ideas or other variants, otherwise they are simply voting proposals, that is, governance ideas that may have as a result the modification of another cooperation.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Other variants are part of the first two types of ideas.</p><br>
      <p class="base">All cooperations belong to Cooperacy, a not-for-profit institution. Its processes are based on two simple principles, with a large-small, or parent-children structure.</p><br>
      <p class="base">The Governance</p><br>
      <p class="base">The first principle is coordinators have leadership, that is, take direct decisions over the cooperations’ they coordinate, but they must communicate their choices. When they do, the decision takes place.</p><br>
      <p class="base">The second is that participants have chorality. </p><br>
      <p class="base">Chorality means that if they want they can issue or modify decisions together with or independently from the coordinators, given that they have internal chorality as well. So chorality is a governance possibility represented by a social state, similar to a social equilibrium. Chorality does not mean full consensus (although it may happen), but it means that they have discussed, included and informed the minorities and integrated creatively the contrasts. For the meaning of proportional creative integration refer to our website, although substantially it means to compensate or to decisionally represent the minority or the opposition using when needed a bit of creativity and not simply just splitting the budget according to the votes.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Minorities and opposition</p><br>
      <p class="base">If at least two people are against a coordinators’ decision or a chorality-based one, they can ask for integration and the coordinators together with the other participants should create a possible compensation or creative integration of the participants’ opposing position, following the seven solutions.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Structure</p><br>
      <p class="base">“Large” or “Parent” cooperations include “small” or “child” cooperations. The largest parent of all cooperations is Cooperacy.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Voting allowance</p><br>
      <p class="base">Small cooperations may issue ideas proposals relative to the larger ones, and need the larger cooperation votes, like when a department proposes a change that affects the whole institution. </p><br>
      <p class="base">So the voting allowance of decisions regarding a inner cooperation is only its participants’. When a decision affects an outer cooperation instead, the voting should be extended.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Back to Legal</p><br>
      <p class="base">Besides this described decision making process, most of Cooperacy's Agreements explain your relationship with Cooperacy. This section is different — it explains the relationship between coordinators of ideas and voters, between them and future active cooperations, and who’s responsible for what. This is what you’re agreeing to when you coordinate or vote in Cooperacy.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Every idea has minimum two coordinators. They are the managers of the idea. If you want to propose the idea and not be its coordinator, just say that in the idea forum, new coordinators will arrive and you will choose. For the fact you will choose the coordinators, you will be the coordinators until you choose a new one or let people vote internally for new coordinators. Coordinators, if nothing changes the course of the process, will be coordinating the cooperation.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Cooperacy provides a redistributive funding, an employment distribution service and a governance platform. This is because we want a social ecosystem that redistributes wealth, governance and activities. In particular, we would like you to do the activity that mostly adheres to your personality and preferences. When a coordinator posts an idea in Cooperacy, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who votes a cooperation is accepting the coordinators’ offer, and forming that contract. The contract approximately says: if you vote this idea or cooperation, and participate this cooperation, you want to realize and support the cooperation, and accept that human, economic and other resources will be used the way coordinators prospected, keeping intact their two governance principles, the chorality and the 3-day change.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Cooperacy is a part of this contract — the contract is a direct internal agreement between the coordinators, the voters, and Cooperacy. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:</p><br>
      <p class="base">when a cooperation idea receives its desired budget or hudget (required money or required human resources commitment or clients), the coordinators must complete the seven states of the cooperation. Once the coordinators have done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their ideas voters, and can turn the cooperation idea into an active one, kick-off it and celebrate.</p><br>
      <p class="base">Throughout the process, coordinators grant their voters-participants a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the cooperation to life. At the same time, voters must understand that when they vote a cooperation, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the coordinators from being able to finish the cooperation as promised.</p><br>
      <p class="base">If the coordinators are unable to complete their cooperation steps, that is, the voters vote against during the cooperation milestones, the cooperation or idea does not die: coordinators may be changed amongst the participants of the cooperation or the participants of Cooperacy. Coordinators may also renounce to bring forward their cooperation, with a post explaining what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the cooperation as planned: they should demonstrate to have been working diligently and in good faith to bring the cooperation to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to voters; they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the cooperation as promised; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to voters; they leave any remaining funds to voters-participants of the cooperations who may decide to return the funds to the Cooperacy collection fund or continue the development of the cooperation.</p><br>
      <p class="base">The coordinators are therefore responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their cooperation. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of these Agreements, for example if they spent the money for their own private advantage, they may be subject to legal action by voters or Cooperacy itself.</p><br>
      <p class="base">How Funding Works</p><br>
      <p class="base">This section goes over the details of voting ideas and cooperations — things like how money gets collected, whether ideas can be changed or canceled, and how coordinators can fulfil their commitment.</p><br>
      <p class="base">These are the terms that apply when you’re voting a cooperation:</p><br>
      <p class="base">You, as participant of Cooperacy, generate a collection fund with your personal subscription fee. You do not owe anything more to the coordinators. The funds requested -in case of a funded idea- is only transferred by the collection fund if the idea reaches its budget goal during the pre-allocation phase. Until the idea has reached its budget goal, no funds will be transferred, and nobody will be in charge of that sum. The money that has been collected thanks to the votes is preallocated, that is, is reserved for that idea, until the cooperation phase starts. The cooperation receives its funds in seven steps, called milestones, according to the voters-participants support.</p><br>
      <p class="base">More in detail, you are sending Cooperacy a monthly fee at your own risk, knowing how the platform works, having read this agreement and believing in the idea of a redistributed model that will enable people to fulfil their ideas in time and results according to how much the community likes and trusts their proposal. All of us, including you, will do our best to make our Site the best place for cooperation and mutual enjoyment, but we may fail and learn from our failures.

      <p class="base">The subscription fee you send Cooperacy generates a collection fund that will be distributed to the ideas proposals of the participants according to an algorithm here presented.</p><br>
      <p class="base">
        <ul>
          <li><em>The collection fund is distributed as preallocated every second to the cooperation ideas according to their percentages, calculated with the number of the equivalence votes the budget cooperation idea has, divided by the total of all the equivalence votes all the ideas have (Vi / Vt ).</em></li>
          <li><em>The preallocation of the budget cooperation ideas could be brought to 0 if there is no more activity on it by more than two users after 90 days, the user is contacted and gives no response, unless it has more than 50% of the budget, in that case the pre-allocated budget is kept safe</em></li>
          <li><em>The preallocation of the budget idea is brought to 0 if the idea has a relative deadline, or a deadline connected with the hudget</em></li>
          <li><em>When a cooperation has a strong “bizardry” (diversity votes), it has more opportunities to be randomly approved. Every idea has a bizardry percentage, calculated by its diversity votes over the total diversity votes of the system (BVi / BVt ). Every idea, the first day of a season, is given a random percentage value between 0% and 10%, to which the bizardry percentage is added. The idea that has the highest percentage has a virtual added equivalence votes percentage of +50% [(Vi+50%*Vt ) / Vt ]. Last minute high increments of diversity votes will be turned into transparency votes.</em></li>
          <li><em>Inner cooperation budget ideas are intended to be voted and supported by their outer cooperation's internal budget. Budget ideas that want the Cooperacy collection fund distribution MUST be inner of Cooperacy main cooperation to receive any budget pre-allocation, and then can be inserted as subcooperation of any cooperation.</em></li>
          <li><em>If transparency negative votes, subtracted of half of the trust votes, are more than 25% of equivalence votes (JVt-50%*TVt > 25%*Vt ) the idea or cooperation is blocked into testing state until the coordinators clarify. After 90 days of this blockage the budget is turned back to the collection fund.</em></li>
          <li><em>Any direct donation to a cooperation idea counts as donated budget. Donated budget and pre-allocated budget count as per the fulfilment of the idea budget to be turned into a cooperation, but donated budget cannot be returned to the collection fund unless the idea is rescinded or abandoned.</em></li>
          <li><em>Once the idea has reached the budget and/or hudget, the participants of the idea are kept frozen during the cooperation phase until the cooperation is turned into an active idea. The budget release to cooperation has 7 milestones or steps. The milestones deadlines are chosen according to the Cooperacy governance scheme, starting from the coordinators.</em></li>
          <li><em>If trust votes are more than 75% of equivalence votes (TVi >75%Vi ) first milestone is directly approved</em></li>
          <li><em>Eventual contrasts not resolved in the 7 milestones are solved voting, the voting is kept live for three days, in which the participants can change their votes, after which the voting is valid. The coordinators have three more days to try to creatively integrate the contrasting positions, during which the votes can only rise as positive supporting votes are frozen. At the end of a week time, the milestone has to be decided.</em></li>
          <li><em>All the contrasting votes not integrated reduce the budget, which goes back to the collection fund. In that case, the cooperation turns back to the cooperation idea state, keeping the milestones approved, and waits again for the fulfilment of the missing budget cut due to contrasting positions.</em></li>
          <li><em>Current minimum budget for funded ideas is 1000 euros or equivalent.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>
      <p class="base">Other mechanisms regulate other functions of the Cooperacy platform, like:
        <ul>
          <li><em>The visibility of the ideas proposals are enhanced by the care votes in percentage (HVi /HVt )</em></li>
          <li><em>Voters can change their equivalence vote anytime during the idea phase.</em></li>
          <li><em>Voters of an idea become participants of that idea and of the future active cooperation. When the cooperation goes into the approval phase, voters can leave the cooperation and let it develop on its own. This is not considered an opposition.</em></li>
          <li><em>Trust votes in a budget 0 idea indicate participation as Trustee, that is, as a client, affiliate, pre-buy, subscription to a course or pre-purchase to a concert. This VINCULATES the trustee to the payment of the relative pre-purchase after the first milestone is passed.</em></li>
          <li><em>High transparency negative voted ideas go to a final year list in which the most negative voted idea wins the prize of trolling or joke cooperation idea of the year.</em></li>
          <li><em>Freedom votes are only inherent to helping or working in the cooperation and fill in the requested hudget.</em></li>
          <li><em>AI suggestions are automatically assigned and act as reference.</em></li>
          <li><em>System registers full date of all votes</em></li>
          <li><em>Co-donation amount indicates the maximum amount you are willing to donate for the realization of the idea, that will be the same for all the co-donators. The system periodically evaluates the lowest of all amounts promised and multiplies for the number of the codonators in order to evaluate if the budget is reached. If not reached, the system evaluates other combination possibilities (all the amounts multiplied by the people who can afford more) able to reach the budget. Once turned into a cooperation, the codonations are billed to your bank account, credit card or any other possibility the Site allows.</em></li>
          <li><em>City or Location cooperations are geographic units and are highlighted in blue. They can be default cooperations that can have inner ones.</em></li>
          <li><em>Cooperation ideas can have other highlights like cyan for “educational”, violet for “scientific”, and green for “environmental” ones. You are free to use these labels, but if they are misleading they can make people transparency unvote them.</em></li>
          <li><em>People who freedom-voted an idea become participants of the cooperation.</em></li>
          <li><em>When the cooperation becomes an active one, the idea is “born”, has a birthdate, and can receive a three level feedback (+,=,-)</em></li>
          <li><em>In case of final transformation of an active cooperation, for example when a course ends, its final step is to go to a general archive. This step is called “death” and turns the cooperation into a “memory”, where the AI analyzes it and the people may still give some feedback.</em></li>
          <li><em>Participants Gender (M / F / Other) will be in the future signal the cooperations composition.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>
