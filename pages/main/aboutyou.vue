    <br />

    <p class="base">
      You could be one who believes that doing things together is advantageous
      and useful to bring a real change, but you would like to do it keeping a
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#freedom" class="af"
        >personal space for yourself</nuxt-link
      >.<br /><br />

      Or you may be one of those who believe that
      <nuxt-link to="/main/platform" class="ae">changing the world</nuxt-link> starts
      with a new
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation" class="au">awareness</nuxt-link
      >.<br /><br />

      For example, you may believe in
      <nuxt-link to="/main/research" class="au">science</nuxt-link> and technology
      but want them to be respectful of the people’s
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#care" class="ac">feelings</nuxt-link
      >.<br /><br />

      Maybe you don’t want to be constantly influenced in your
      <nuxt-link to="/main/governance" class="af">decisions</nuxt-link>. You
      want to follow your true desires, making your abilities meet your
      professional
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#freedom" class="af">life</nuxt-link>. You
      probalby dream about a social system that
      <nuxt-link to="/main/integration" class="ad">integrates</nuxt-link> the
      different personalities of everyone in a creative and balanced way.<br /><br />

      You could be looking for an open world, where you’re not afraid to be
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#transparency" class="ai"
        >honest</nuxt-link
      >
      all the time because people and institutions agree to share information in
      a
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#transparency" class="ae"
        >transparent</nuxt-link
      >
      way.<br /><br />
    </p>

    <p class="base diversity">Or maybe not.</p>
    <br />

    <p class="base">
      Maybe you feel at one with the
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#care" class="ac">planet</nuxt-link>, and
      think it’s more important to give back all the care and nourishment we
      received so far. You value
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#diversity" class="ad">beauty</nuxt-link>
      and
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#equivalence" class="ae"
        >happiness</nuxt-link
      >
      as fundamental for everyone and everything.<br /><br />

      Another possibility, instead, is that you are concerned about wars and
      hunger and see them as an effect of the way wealth is
      <nuxt-link to="/main/platform" class="ae">distributed</nuxt-link>. So you would
      like an economy based not on numbers, productivity and surplus only, but
      also on
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#care" class="ac">caring</nuxt-link>,
      sustainability, real assets, traditional shops and activities coordinated
      by “multilocal” companies. You may be wanting safe and fair water access,
      healthy food, recyclable materials and traditional processes instead of
      harmful excessive
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#diversity" class="ad"
        >standardizations.</nuxt-link
      ><br /><br />

      Or maybe, instead, you’ve just been looking for a way to make your
      <nuxt-link to="/main/participate" class="ae"
        >daily little effort</nuxt-link
      >
      valuable to bring the changes you wish for.<br /><br />

      All these are different beliefs, but together, they can create a wealthy
      and enjoyable social ecosystem. Your belief becomes even more crucial when
      seen together with the other ones.<br /><br />
