    <p class="base">
      Cooperacy Overview is a methodology that allows to measure the conditions
      of <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation" class="ae">Cooperation</nuxt-link> in
      your organisation in order to obtain a complete overview of your social
      ecosystem. This would allow you to have a deeper
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#understanding" class="au"
        >understanding</nuxt-link
      >
      of your human resources interactions and how they could be improved in
      cooperation and ecosystemic terms.

      What could be the measure of

      your organization? What could measure the

      <nuxt-link to="/cci" class="au">indexes</nuxt-link> may be identified in
      your social ecosystem in order to overview what changes could drive to a
      more balanced and growth-oriented performance.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">POSSIBLE ECOSYSTEMIC INTERVENTIONS</p>
    <p class="base">
      Once the Overview is completed, identifying the possible interventions
      becomes an easier task. Nevertheless, in order to apply the required
      changes, it is very important to respect the ecosystemic
      <nuxt-link to="/main/cooperation#care" class="ac">relations</nuxt-link> in
      order not to break their balances. The final step in the Cooperacy
      Overview methodology is therefore to schedule gradual transformations that
      may finally result in an organic evolution able to foster, together with
      the desired growth, mutual enjoyment in the human resources involved. The
      transformation proposed follow the Cooperacy Group's
      <nuxt-link to="/main/journey" class="au">Journey</nuxt-link>
      methodology.<br /><br />
