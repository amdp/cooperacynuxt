    <p class="base">
    Cooperacy Research Association represents the scientific branch of Cooperacy, founded as an independent research group on the 23rd September 2014.<br><br>

    The research investigation questions what is <a class="ae" href="/cooperation">Cooperation</a> and what are its conditions, in order to <a class="au" href="/cooperation#understanding">understand</a> how to <a class="ac" href="/cooperation#care">coordinate</a> human <a class="ad" href="/cooperation#diversity">diversity</a> towards mutual enjoyment and better ecosystemic awareness.<br>

    During 2014, a group of 7 independent researchers investigated from different disciplines and perspectives the model of Cooperation Science developed by Alessandro Merletti De Palo based on an extensive literature review about Cooperation and its many different frameworks.<br><br>
    The model, based on interdisciplinary systemic <a class="au" href="/coscience">approach</a>, was confirmed by the investigations results, and the subsequent paper was accepted at the M.I.T. 2015 <a class="au" href="http://cci.mit.edu/">Collective Intelligence</a> Conference in Santa Clara, organized by the <a class="au" href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs">University of Michigan - Ann Arbour</a>.<br><br>
    Since 2015 the Cooperacy group became the Cooperacy Research Association legal entity with the official registration in Milan together with the co-founder Ilario Tito.<br><br>
    <p class="base">The Cooperation Science framework has been presented in 2015 at the <a class="au" href="http://2015.ouisharefest.com/">OuiShareFest</a>, the leading worldwide event about the emerging phenomenon of the Sharing Economy, held in Paris. Afterwards our approach has been refined with semantic clusters and shown during the <a class="au" href="https://www.iasc-commons.org/">IASC</a> <a class="au" href="http://urbancommons.labgov.it/">conference</a> in Bologna organized by LabGov.<br>
    In 2016 Cooperacy has been invited in the first International Conference on Positive Peace held by the Institute for Economics and Peace at Stanford and presented the model at the <a class="au" href="http://summit.g0v.tw/2016/">g0v Conference</a> in Taipei as well as in Germany, Hamburg, at the official <a class="au" href="http://www.openproduction.info/">Conference for Coproduction systems</a>. Our preliminary <a class="au" href="/cci">Cooperation Context Index</a> together with Facebook Group Cooperation analysis were presented at the <a class="au" href="https://sites.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/collective-intelligence-conference/">2016 Collective Intelligence Conference</a> at the <a class="au" href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/">New York Stern School of Business</a>.<br>

In September 2017 Cooperacy has been invited to hold two workshops at the <a class="au" href="http://techfestival.co/">Techfestival</a> week in Copenhagen and to be part of the <a class="au" href="http://techfestival.co/cph150/">cph150</a>, a progressive 2-day think tank on the relationship between technologies and humans who produced the <a class="au" href="https://copenhagenletter.org/">Copenhagen Letter</a>.<br><br>
