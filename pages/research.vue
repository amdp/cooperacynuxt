      COOPERACY RESEARCH ASSOCIATION

    <p class="base">
      Cooperacy Research Association represents the scientific branch of
      Cooperacy, founded as an independent research group on the 23rd September
      2014.<br /><br />

      The research investigation questions what is
      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation" class="ae">Cooperation</nuxt-link> and what
      are its conditions, in order to

      <nuxt-link to="/cooperation#diversity" class="ad">diversity</nuxt-link>
      towards mutual enjoyment and better ecosystemic awareness.<br />

      During 2014, a group of 7 independent researchers investigated from
      different disciplines and perspectives the model of Cooperation Science
      developed by Alessandro Merletti De Palo based on an extensive literature
      review about Cooperation and its many different frameworks.<br /><br />
      The model, based on interdisciplinary systemic
      <nuxt-link to="/coscience" class="au">approach</nuxt-link>, was confirmed
      by the investigations results, and the subsequent paper was accepted at
      the M.I.T. 2015
      <a href="http://cci.mit.edu/" class="au">Collective Intelligence</a>
      Conference in Santa Clara, organized by the
      <a class="au" href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs"
        >University of Michigan - Ann Arbour</a
      >.<br /><br />
      Since 2015 the Cooperacy group became the Cooperacy Research Association
      legal entity with the official registration in Milan together with the
      co-founder Ilario Tito.<br /><br />

      The Cooperation Science framework has been presented in 2015 at the
      <a class="au" href="http://2015.ouisharefest.com/">OuiShareFest</a>, the
      leading worldwide event about the emerging phenomenon of the Sharing
      Economy, held in Paris. Afterwards our approach has been refined with
      semantic clusters and shown during the
      <a class="au" href="https://www.iasc-commons.org/">IASC</a>
      <a class="au" href="http://urbancommons.labgov.it/">conference</a> in
      Bologna organized by LabGov.<br />
      In 2016 Cooperacy has been invited in the first International Conference
      on Positive Peace held by the Institute for Economics and Peace at
      Stanford and presented the model at the
      <a class="au" href="http://summit.g0v.tw/2016/">g0v Conference</a> in
      Taipei as well as in Germany, Hamburg, at the official
      <a class="au" href="http://www.openproduction.info/"
        >Conference for Coproduction systems</a
      >. Our preliminary
      <nuxt-link to="/cci" class="au">Cooperation Context Index</nuxt-link>
      together with Facebook Group Cooperation analysis were presented at the
      <a
