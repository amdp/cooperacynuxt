If there is not enough autonomy and personal empowerment, the group may start conflicting and may need to separate.

Other times, the separation makes it easier to grow for the new groups born out of the splitting. Try this approach. How useful is it?",
    "PI": "It is important that information or personal points of view are shared and expressed. Moreover, they should be accepted by the group, no matter how the participants react to them. When truths are difficult to say, try to expose the principles that made up the choice besides any judgements, those principles may be shared. When truths are difficult to hear, give as much precise information as possible to help guide the understanding of how that truth was generated or that fact happened. Try this approach. How useful is it?",
    "PC": "When taking decisions or discussing delicate topics, the participants need an environment that is pleasurable, comfortable and is able to meet the needs of the participants.

    "PT": "Sometimes the group needs to wait. This waiting time could be used to find common measurement tools to evaluate the situation and the results. Let the group keep trusting the current or previous decisions, wait for a while and then evaluate their outcomes with common principles and methodologies. Try this approach. How useful is it?",
    "PE": "If the group doesn't know which solution to take or if there is a contrast between different approaches, it could be very useful to experiment with the different ideas giving them turns. Sometimes contrasting ideas or people can be useful together, combining them, or finding specific roles for each one of them. For example, in a contrast between someone wanting more innovation and someone wanting more security, you may give them or their ideas specific roles in the group for it to be innovative in a safe way.  Try this approach. How useful is it?",
    "AFinalNote": "<i>Again, how do we decide together? This is the fundamental question. If nothing worked so far, Cooperacy invites you to try our basic process:</i> <br /><br /><p class=\"understanding\">IN SHORT - Find a beautiful place in which you feel good and list all the different informations and options you have, then underline the values they are based upon. Merge them or create new ones. If needed, vote for them. Finally, take turns to experiment with them for some time and then evaluating the results: start from the most voted and if someone renounces to their solution, find a way to compensate their renounce. If you still struggle, separate the group, giving each part of it a proportional part of the space, the resources and the power involved.</p>1. Give a moment to everyone in order to be aware of their own state, be it the emotional one, the one related to health, hunger or other needs, or be it context related, like warmth, coldness, luminosity, the beauty of the surroundings or anything else you may want to consider.<br />2. List all the different positions in the group and relative information, without blocking anyone to express theirs, asking for explanation on any unclear position<br />3. Check which similarities are present in the choices proposed and write close to each one of them what is the value and the purpose behind the proposal. Find out if the different proposals or purposes may become parallel areas, or even functions, roles or responsibilities for the people proposing them.<br />4. If the situation is still unclear and someone has strict positions against one or more of the choices proposed, be transparent and explain why, then try to creatiely merge the current ones, or forget them completely and invent new ones. Brainstorm solutions, allowing enough time to the creative process and forgetting what is right or wrong. <br />5. If a choice does not arise, make the participants give maximum one vote to any position they like, even all of them, without being influenced by peers. If you are alone or in two, give a value between 1 and 100 or proceed intiutively. <br />6. Never choose only the most voted solution, but making proportions according to the votes, dedicating parts of your efforts, time and resources to develop or to test all the choices, even making turns for each one of them and compensating those people whose proposal is abandoned. For example, if just two people want to create a gardening course, you may compensate them with a gardening book or buying a plant they should take care of.<br />7. Finally, evaluate the results and in case go back to 1. If nothing works, make a long pause. After it, if there is still friction, try to find a way to separate the group with care and in a balanced way, subdividing proportionally the available space, power and resources.<br /><br /> ",
