    "grouppairingintro": "PAIRING: READ BEFORE APPLYING<br />Use this part of the survey to pair your group, that is, to resolve internal conflicts. <br />You will also find final methodology advices. <br />",
    "grouppairingintro2": "<br />The pairing tool is an innovative tool by Cooperacy that brings people to 'pair' their fundamental principles, in order to 'tune' the orientation of the human beliefs and then establish a methodology to take decisions.<br /><br />The main question, 'how do we decide together', is the fundamental one. While the secret of self awareness held by gurus and spiritual masters in India leads to asking 'Who am I?', the secret of social coordination lies in the question 'How do we decide together?'<br />It is an invitation to establish a methodology about what to pratically do before taking a collective action in order to chose together. So the question isn't WHAT the group should do, but HOW the group decides what to do. Every group of people, even large 'social ecosystems', can decide its own. In our pairing tool, we propose a systematic way to do it, but just asking yourself and your group about it should be enough.",
    "PBase": "How do we decide together? Do you have any methodology to follow in order to take collective decisions?",
    "details": "If you want, add some details:",
    "PD": "Be creative, brainstorm! If you can't find the right solution, remember creativity may solve your situation. Sometimes the group want to be perfect, just and do the most righteous thing, but the creative mind can find an incredible different solution. Try this approach at first. Is it useful?",
    "PU": "List or discuss what are your participants most important principles and filter the ones in common. For example, even two opponent soldiers in a war may have their family safety in common. Use your common principles to evaluate your decisions. Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "PF": "Check that all the participants have some personal space, both physical one and space for personal action. If it is not so, the group may need to separate. Separation is not 'bad', sometimes is a good natural step. Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "PI": "It is important that any information that is not shared or any point of view that is not expressed should come up and overall be accepted by the group, no matter how bad it is. When truths are difficult to say or hear, give as much precise information as possible to understand how that truth come up and the principles that made up the choice behind the truth itself. Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "PC": "When taking decisions or discussing delicate topics, the participants need a good environment and the right level of respect or care about their basic and intellectual needs. Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "PT": "Sometimes the group needs to wait and meanwhile find measurements tool to evaluate the situation giving it a little more time. Trust your previous decisions while you evaluate them. Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "PE": "If the group doesn't know which solution to take or if there is a contrast between different approaches, it could be very useful to experiment the different solutions giving them turns. Sometimes contrasting ideas or people can be useful together, combining them, or finding specific roles for each one of them. For example, in a contrast between someone wanting more innovation and someone wanting more security, you may give them specific roles in the group for it to be innovative in a safe way.  Try this approach. Is it useful?",
    "AFinalNote": "<i>Again, how do we decide together? This is the fundamental question. If nothing worked so far, Cooperacy invites you to try our basic process:</i> <br /><br /><p class=\"understanding\">IN SHORT - Find a beautiful place in which you feel good and list the informations and the different options you have, then underline the values they are based upon. Merge them or create new ones, in case vote for them. Finally, make turns to experiment them dando fiducia ad alcune di esse e valutandone i risultati: start from the most voted and compensate those who renounce to their solution. If you still struggle, separate the group, giving each part of it a proportional space.</p>1. Give a moment to everyone in order to be aware of their own state, be it the emotional one, the one related to health, hunger or other needs, or be it context related, like warmth, coldness, luminosity, beauty of the surroundings and everything you may want to consider.<br />2. List all the different positions in the group, and relative information, without blocking anybody to express theirs and eventually ask explanation for any unclear position<br />3. Check which are the similarities in the choices proposed and write close to each one of them what is the value and the purpose behind the proposal. Find out if the different proposals or purposes may become parallel areas or functions, roles or responsibilities for the people proposing them.<br />4. If the situation is still unclear and someone has strict positions against one or more of the choices proposed, be transparent and explain why, then try to creatiely merge the current ones, or forget them completely and invent new ones. Brainstorm solutions, giving long time to the creative process and forgetting what is right or wrong. <br />5. If a choice does not arise, make the participants give maximum one vote to any position they like, even all of them, without being influenced by peers. If you are alone or in two, give a value between 1 and 100 or proceed intiutively. <br />6. Never choose only the most voted solution, but making proportions according to the votes, dedicate parts of your efforts, resources and time to develop or to test all the choices, in case making turns for each one of them and compensating those people whose proposal is abandoned.<br />7. Evaluate the results and in case go back to 1. If nothing works, make a long pause, and in case find a way to separate the group with care and in a balanced way, subdividing proportionally the available space and resouces.<br /><br /> ",
