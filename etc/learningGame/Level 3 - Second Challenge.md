### CHALLENGE TWO: REGISTER AND MAKE A LITTLE EDIT IN MYSQL

Okay then let's use the platform.
Go to LOGIN as in the right menu.
Scroll down and enter your name,
surname, email and password..
eventually a pic of yours.
Nothing will be sent to the 
real cooperacy cooperation, so
don't worry and hit on bank transfer.


A new user will be created without any 
bank transfer. Now, open your mysql
workbench software or similar and
open the user table.

Refer to the beginning section of this
document to click in the small icon and
make the table to appear.


Now find your user, and edit "payment
deadline". Insert any date AFTER today
remembering the format is `YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00`
obviously you can edit the time `00:00:00`
but it doesn't really change the situation.


Apply your changes and try to login with
your credentials. If you did, congratulations!
You passed challenge two! Please post in
the discord channel the screenshot of your
user when you are logged in :)
