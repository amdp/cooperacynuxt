### CHALLENGE 2: INSTALL MYSQL AND APACHE
Please install Mysql 5.7 ([https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html#downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html#downloads))

On windows, [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html) (Note: MySQL Installer is 32 bit, but will install both 32 bit and 64 bit binaries.)

This step is not easy! If you find it difficult ASK!

To create a new database in MySql just 
follow the many guides online, we suggest you
to use mysql workbench:
https://www.mysql.com/it/products/workbench/

Once connected, create a new database and 
it is suggested to set up a new user granting it
all privileges for the database you created. 
Remember to give the user a password. 
Then log out and log in again not with root, 
but with the user.

Then you should run the long list of commands 
you find in the file dumbdatabase.sql in the 
/etc folder of the repo: open it or just copy ALL
the text and then paste it in the sql command box
in any database/sql editor/online tool like
workbench, only after you connected to your newly 
created database. This will give you some dumb data
to test the platform. In workbench, just open the sql
or copy its text into a sql command/query.

PS: Remember to start your mysql server!

NOTE: we recently edited the dumbdatabase so if
you encounter problems please let us know.

Workbench is strange to use at the beginning but
once you copied the dunb database just 
remember to open the left side pane "schema" 
and to click on tables, you will see a list of
tables and to see the actual data or schema
click on the tiny icon close to the same name:

When you have done this step, just install Apache too
or any other http server.
At the end, edit the contributors.md 
and add your email after your name! You did it!!
