## LEVEL TWO: NUXT BASE LEARNING

### CHALLENGE ONE: THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

This first challenge is made of reading.
If you read carefully you will be passing it!

What is Nuxt? NUXT IS A VUE FRAMEWORK
It is used to have a quicker development
of a universal application (server side
rendered, progressive web app ready,
mobile ready, desktop ready, etc.)

Remember you start Nuxt with

`npm run dev`

and you stop it with CONTROL-C .
Try and test these two commands and
check that when you see nuxt
compiling/loading, you can open the
browser and see it load clientside:
you will see the green nuxt icon
and the load bars :)

Good. The directory structure in NUXT is made of
these folders:

ASSETS = css, images, etc

COMPONENTS = vue components, "reusable parts"

LAYOUTS = layouts, like presets with footer and header

node_modules = BIG folder with all the node modules

PAGES = web vue dynamic pages

STATIC = try not to use this,
it is not SERVER SIDE RENDERED NOR GENERALLY "NUXTED"
we will leave only the favicon and user/cooperation images here

STORE = VUEX, or "variables shared in all vue pages"

note: keep in mind for your projects that STORE
works in nuxt only if you put an index.js file there
no file, no store

Got it? Good. Screenshot the directory structure
in your local repo
send it to the discord server and you
would have passed CHALLENGE ONE!
