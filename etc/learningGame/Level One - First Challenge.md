![Image](assets/image/github/image3.png)


## LEVEL ONE

So let's begin! Overcome the following challenges
to get deeper and deeper in the learning of
the different coding aspects!

### CHALLENGE ONE: GITHUB!

If you pass this challenge you 
will be approaching the contributors 
zone, and be listed in the 
contributors.md file of this repo.

Cooperacy is based on GitHub repositories. 
You find them here: https://github.com/amdp/cooperacynuxt

For detailed and complete guide please see 
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/.
If you do not want to follow the guide, please… ask 😄

Git is quite complicated for newcomers 
so it is important for you to tell your 
difficulties. It is important that you learn it
too though, because most of the world projects 
are updated thanks to the git process.

**Basically all you need to do is:**
1.  Creating github account.
    
2.  [Fork the repository]
https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo
and clone your fork 
(read https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Branch-VS-Fork/td-p/10619 )
    
3.  Create a new branch in your fork
    
4.  Work with it, edit, write new code
    
5.  Test it locally
    
6.  Request a Pull / Merge
    
7.  Await for integration!

Last but not least, have fun.

For doubts about every step, please ask! :)

**Note:**

When you create a new branch on the 
clone of your fork, you can mess 
around as much as you like, you won't 
destroy the software. When you want to
issue a pull request, you should send 
only the changes that really matter, 
not everything you changed for testing. 
So the branch is your playground, but 
when you want your changes to be sent 
to the main program for integration 
you tidy everything up and issue your 
pull request.

***As per your first challenge, 
edit the contributors.md file 
and insert you in the "learners" list.***

Finally, make a pull request and you're done!
