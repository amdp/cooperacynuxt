![Image](/assets/image/github/image3.png)

## LEVEL ONE

So let's begin! Overcome the following challenges
to get deeper and deeper in the learning of
the different coding aspects!

### CHALLENGE ONE: GITHUB!

If you pass this challenge you
will be approaching the contributors
zone, and be listed in the
contributors.md file of this repo.

Cooperacy is based on GitHub repositories.
You find them here: https://github.com/amdp/cooperacynuxt

For detailed and complete guide please see
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/.
If you do not want to follow the guide, pleaseâ€¦ ask ðŸ˜„

Git is quite complicated for newcomers
so it is important for you to tell your
difficulties. It is important that you learn it
too though, because most of the world projects
are updated thanks to the git process.

**Basically all you need to do is:**

1.  Creating github account.

2.  [Fork the repository]
    https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo
    and clone your fork
    (read https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Branch-VS-Fork/td-p/10619 )
3.  Create a new branch in your fork

4.  Work with it, edit, write new code

5.  Test it locally

6.  Request a Pull / Merge

7.  Await for integration!

Last but not least, have fun.

For doubts about every step, please ask! :)

** Important **
You should always check your master
clone branch is updated. So, if you
use command line, you should go into
the repo main folder and issue "git
pull". If you are in vsc, click on
the circle "recycle" little icon in
the footer-status bar below. If you
use other tools, check how to pull
but keep your repo master branch
always updated otherwise you could
be working on an old repo or even
a non-working one.

**Note:**

When you create a new branch on the
clone of your fork, you can mess
around as much as you like, you won't
destroy the software. When you want to
issue a pull request, you should send
only the changes that really matter,
not everything you changed for testing.
So the branch is your playground, but
when you want your changes to be sent
to the main program for integration
you tidy everything up and issue your
pull request.

**_As per your first challenge,
edit the contributors.md file
and insert you in the "learners" list._**

Finally, make a pull request and you're done!
